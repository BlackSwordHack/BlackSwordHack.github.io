<p>Antagonists are presented as follows: their name and level, a short description, traits or technical peculiarities, and actions (marked with ) they can take on their Turn. If an action can be avoided or stopped with an attribute test, the attribute is written in brackets next to the action’s name. The number listed after is the damage if the test is failed.</p>
<p>The GM is free to improvise actions as needed. A disarmed peasant can punch (if angry enough), a first born soldier can attempt to trip or shove a character when fighting on a narrow bridge, a giant boar can gore if it doesn’t have enough room to charge, etc. The damage should fit with the other actions presented.
Enemies get one action and one move each turn. They can’t use the same action twice.</p>


        <h3>7.1. NPC Stats on the Fly</h3>
<p>The following table tells the GM how much damage an average NPC of a specific level should be able to take (HP column) and dish out (damage column).</p>

<table>
        <tbody>
<tr>    <th>Level</th>  <th> HP</th>    <th> Damage</th></tr>

            <h3>7.1.1. Armoured Opponents</h3> 
To avoid unnecessary arithmetics, simply add a few HP: 2 (light armour), 3 (medium armour) or 4 (Full plate or equivalent).

            <h3>7.1.2. Vulnerability & Resistance</h3> 
A vulnerability means attackers get Advantage on their damage roll while resistance means they get Disadvantage on damage. Popular choices include fire, frost, lightning, Chaotic or Lawful attackers, etc.

                </div>
              <div class="col-6 col-12-small">

            <h3>7.1.3. Enemy Morale</h3> 
Aside from the most die-hard fanatics, human antagonists will surrender or flee if they have less than 3 HP left or if they lose half of their forces. Same goes if the characters use runic weapons, magic, demons, or spirits against unsuspecting foes (and this may affect the characters’ reputation as well).

        <h3>7.3. What Do You Find on The Corpse?</h3> 
<p>This is a game about taking part in the conflict between Law and Chaos, and looting corpses shouldn’t become a habit. On most humanoid characters you’ll find: d6 coins (even wealthy merchants keep their money at home). Gems usually have a value of d6x100 coins, same goes for most valuables (from silverware to a fine painting). A treasure chest can contain d6x100 coins. If you need something a bit more interesting, simply roll two d12s on the tables below, the first roll will tell you what you find, the second one where it will lead you. No need to roll for every corpse the PCs find (or make).</p>

            <h3>7.3.3. Weapons and Armour</h3>

<p>On other creatures, characters ready to get dirty can find: d6 body parts worth d6x10 coins each (LVL 5 creatures or lower) or d6x100 coins (LVL 6 creatures or higher).</p>
