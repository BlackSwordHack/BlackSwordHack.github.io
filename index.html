                        <h3>1.1. Turns</h3>

        <p>To make sure everyone at the table has a chance to speak, the game uses Turns. At the table, 
        a Turn is the time needed for a character to move and act, it simply refers to that moment you 
        say to a player: “it’s your turn, what do you do?”. In game time, a Turn may represent a few moments
        (during combat), a few minutes (while exploring a house), a few hours (exploring a city) or even a 
        few days (travelling to another city). Regardless, the game is always played in Turns.</p>
        
                        <h3>1.1.1. What does that mean?</h3>

        <p>Suppose the action takes place in a bustling city, as a GM you simply ask each player, 
        one after another, what they wish to do during their turn. As a group, you decide 
        that in this situation, a Turn is half a day.</p>

                        <h3>1.1.2. One turn two actions</h3>

        <p>To make sure no player hogs the spotlight, a character can move and take one action during 
        their turn. The action’s complexity (and the distance covered with a move) depends 
        on the length of the Turn as established by the GM (moments, minutes, hours; etc.).</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="col-6 col-12-small">

                        <div class="box">  
        <p>Here are a few examples:<br><br>
        • “I want to do some shopping.”<br>
        Here they have their move (going to the shops) and their action (shopping). 
        If the character just wants to resupply, they can go to several shops, if it’s
        more involved (looking for specific and rare items or having something custom made)
        they can only do one shop. Then go to the next player!<br><br>
        • “I’d like to do some research.”<br>
        Here you’ll have to ask the player to be a bit more specific: what kind of information 
        do they seek and where? If they answer “I want to learn about the nearby ruins, and so 
        I’ll ask around in taverns and make a trip to the local library”, you’ll have to say “Well,
        spending times with drunks or studying books requires some time, that would be two actions,
        and you can only have one: taverns or library, what will it be?”.</p>
                        </div>


        <p>This helps players prioritise what their character wants or needs to do. If you’re playing online,
        this is a life-saver as it avoids players cutting each other off.  As any rule in this game,
        see it as a guideline: players should still talk between themselves to come up with crazy plans.
        Think of Turns as a metronome that only the GM can hear and helps pace the session.</p>

                <h3>1.2. The Attribute Tests</h3>

<p>When a character wants to do something that has a chance of failure, the player makes an attribute test by rolling a d20. 
The attributes description on p. 20 will tell you which one to use depending on the situation.<br>
• The roll is under the attribute:  the character succeeds.<br>
• The roll is on or over the attribute: the character fails or succeeds at a cost.</p>



                <h3>1.2.1. What is succeeding at a cost?</h3>
<p>This is meant as a way to avoid a game stalling simply because of a failed roll. Here are a few examples tied 
to specific situations:<br>
- Stealth: “You manage to stay hidden but leave traces of your passage behind you...”<br>
- Study: “You find the information you seek but attract unwanted attention” or “The information is incomplete 
and points to an unexpected direction...”<br>
- Climbing: “You don’t fall off the cliff, but you lose your sword...” (or another important item).<br>
- Survival: “You find water and food but the quality is so bad you don’t get the benefits of a long or short rest. 
You’re not starving though...”<br>
- Influence: “Your target interlocutor agrees with you but asks for more...” (more money, more information, more time,
 whatever fits the situation).</p>

        </div>
        <div class="col-6 col-12-small">    
                <h3>1.2.2. Critical Success and Failure</h3>
<p>No matter what the circumstances are:<br>
• A roll of 1 is always a critical success.<br>
• A roll of 20 is always a critical failure.<br>
For attack rolls, a critical success means the character does maximum damage and adds another damage die on top.
Whatever the roll, a critical failure means you have to roll your Doom die immediately.</p>


                <h3>1.2.3. Threat Level</h3>
<p>When a roll affects an NPC or creature (intimidation, influence, combat, etc.), and their level is higher than the character’s
the player must add the level difference to the roll.</p>

                <h3>1.2.4. Group Tests</h3>
<p>In a group effort, if half the characters succeed at their attribute test, the whole group does. 
This is useful when all characters try to be stealthy (Dexterity test) or need to push forward
while crossing a mountain pass (Constitution test). In short, use this rule whenever the 
characters are doing the same thing and are able to help each other.</p>

                <h3>1.3.  Advantage And Disadvantage</h3>
<p>Having Advantage or Disadvantage on a roll means that you roll two dice:<br>
• Advantage allows the Player to choose which result to use.<br>
• Disadvantage means the GM chooses the result to use.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="col-6 col-12-small">  

                <div class="box">
                <p>- For the GM: use this rule to reflect bad or good conditions that can influence an attribute test or a roll, 
                this might be a strained relationship (they try to bribe a guard that dislikes them for example) or having 
                the right tools for the job.<br>
                - For the player: try to create situations where your character can get Advantage: find a better position, help another character, 
                offer a bribe, etc.</p>
                </div>

<p>Advantage and Disadvantage can apply to all die rolls: attribute tests, damage rolls, and any Usage die (see below). If a roll 
happens to have both Advantage and Disadvantage, they cancel each other (no matter how many Advantages and Disadvantages you have).</p>


        </div>
</div>






        

<hr class="major">  






<div class="row"> 
        <div class="col-6 col-12-small">    
                <h3>1.4. Usage Die (Ud)</h3>
        <p>Some things in the game are represented by a Usage die (Ud) to model the fact that they are available in limited quantities.
        In Black Sword Hack we like to use this mechanic to represent mostly abstract resources: such as influence, debts, etc.</p>
        <p>The Usage die should be seen as a “push your luck” mechanic. It can grant you some advantages, but it can also blow up in your
        face at the worst possible moment. Some games use this mechanic to manage concrete resources like rations, or arrows. Not so 
        in Black Sword Hack. Counting 20 arrows is not rocket science nor is recording the use of a week’s worth of rations. A Usage 
        die should represent something important, not the content of one’s backpack.</p>
        <p>When a resource is used, you roll its Usage die; a result of 1 or 2 means the Usage die is downgraded to the next smallest die: <br>
        Ud20>Ud12>Ud10>Ud8>Ud6>Ud4</p>

        </div>
        <div class="col-6 col-12-small">  

        <p>When you roll a 1 or 2 on a Ud4, the resource is depleted.</p>
        <p>As a guide, the average number of uses until the die is depleted for each Ud is as follows: <br>
        Ud20: 30 - Ud12: 20 - Ud10: 14 - Ud8: 9 Ud6: 5 - Ud4: 2.</p>

                <div class="box"><p> An example:<br>
                During the campaign, the GM thinks that an NPC, a mercenary, owes a debt to one of the player characters who saved their life. 
                The GM decides to represent this debt as a d6 Usage die. What does this mean? Each time the PC asks the mercenary for help, 
                they roll the debt Ud. Once the die is depleted, the mercenary will consider their debt paid and will no longer help the 
                character for free.</p>

                <h3>1.5. Distances</h3>
        <p>Black Sword Hack uses four ranges: Close, Nearby, Far away, and Distant. Moving one range requires one move. Depending on 
        the length of a Turn, the actual distance covered by the character will vary. For example in combat:</p>

                <div class="box"> <p>For example in combat:<br><br>
                Close • 1,50 m • 1 square<br>
                Nearby • 10 m • 6 squares<br>
                Far away • 20 m • 12 squares<br>
                Distant • Beyond 20 m<br>
                </p>
                </div>
 

        <p>Outside of combat, measuring distances can be important in situations like chases.</p>

                <div class="box"> 
                <p>For example: <br><br>
                - Hadidja the Swift pursues her target on the rooftops of the Jade City. The target is Far away,
                meaning Hadidja has to cover two range bands to get close to her target (from Far away to Nearby,
                and then from Nearby to Close). The GM simply asks Hadidja’s player to make Dexterity tests.
                Once they get two successes, Hadidja catches up with her target but if they get two failures first, 
                the target runs away.</p>
                </div>

        </div>
        <div class="col-6 col-12-small">   

                <div class="box">                
                <p>- Our band of heroes has entered an underground necropolis. The GM decides that the tomb the characters 
                are looking for is Distant, so it takes three moves to reach it  (from Distant to Far away, from Far away 
                to Nearby, and then from Nearby to Close).</p>
                </div>

                <h3>1.5.1. How long should each Turn last?</h3>
                <p>The GM wants the necropolis to be pretty big, so they go for a half-hour Turn length. Their choice is based on the average 
                speed of a walking human (5 km/3 mi per hour).</p>

                <h3>1.5.2. Turns and distances</h3>
                <p>Using Turns with distances will help you keep track of the passage of time. Even using an overland map, 
                always make sure the players know how long a journey can take. As a rule of thumb, characters travel at 5 km (3 miles) 
                per hour when walking, 55 km (35 miles) per day on horseback, 200 km (120 miles) per day on a sailing ship. These numbers 
                assume good travel conditions (roads or trails, wind, etc.). Divide them by two otherwise (off-road travel, rain, rough sea...).</p>
 
 
                <h3>1.6. Perception</h3>
        <p>When characters are actively looking for something, they find it. If the time taken to find it is a factor, ask for an INT test.</p>

<div class="row">
        <div class="col-6 col-12-small">  

                <h3>1.7. Doom</h3>
        <p>Once they decide to go adventuring, the characters bring the attention of Law and Chaos on themselves. 
        This is represented by the Doom die. Each time a 
        character goes beyond their limits and tempts fate, they must roll their Doom die: the forces of Law and Chaos can, 
        and will, turn the tide one way or another. 
        The Doom die is a Usage die; when it is depleted, the character has brought doom upon themselves.</p>

        <p>In game terms the Doom die is usually rolled when a character:<br><br>
        • Takes the same action twice during a combat Turn (roll before making the test)*.<br>
        • Uses a Gift that requires it.<br>
        • Gets a critical failure on an attribute test.</p>

</div>
<div class="col-6 col-12-small"> 

        <p>The Doom die returns to its maximum after the character has taken a long rest.<br><br>
        Players can choose to “call on Doom”: roll Doom and subtract the result from an attribute test. The Doom die is automatically downgraded without rolling.
        No Doom die anymore? You can’t use actions requiring you roll it.<br><br>
        Once the Doom die is depleted, the character is considered Doomed. All their attribute tests and damage rolls are made with Disadvantage until the 
        character can take a long rest.</p>

                <h3>2.1.  Blood and Souls!</h3>
        <p>First and foremost, the players roll all the dice in combat: when monsters attack, the players 
        simply roll to defend.</p>

                <h3>2.1.1. Initiative</h3>
        <p>At the beginning of a combat, every player makes a WIS test. Those who succeed act before the 
        opposition (monsters and enemy NPCs), starting with the player seated at the left of the GM. The rest 
        act after the opposition, once again, in a clockwise fashion.<br> 
        • A critical success on the initiative roll means you get three actions instead of two on your first turn.<br>
        • A critical failure on the initiative roll means you only get one action instead of two on your first turn.</p>

                <h3>2.1.2. What Can You Do?</h3>
        <p>During their turn, your character can take two actions (move, attack, use something, cast a spell, etc.). 
        Don’t forget you must roll your Doom die if you take the same action twice.</p>
            
                <h3>2.1.3. Attacking</h3>
<p>• Using a melee weapon: make a STR test.<br><br>
• Using a ranged weapon: make a DEX test.<br><br>
A successful attack deals damage (you roll your damage die).<br><br>
A critical success deals maximum damage, and you add another damage die on top of that.</p>

                </div>
                <div class="col-6 col-12-small">    
        
        
                <h3>2.1.4. Defending</h3>
<p>Defending is done during the enemy’s turn; it doesn’t count against the two action limit you get during your own turn. You can defend as many times as you need during your turn.
• Parrying: make a STR test<br><br>
• Dodging: make a DEX test<br><br>
Note: The character must be holding something to be able to parry. Ranged attacks can only be dodged.<br><br>
A failed defense roll means you take damage. <br><br>
A critical failure means your armour is ignored (see below).</p>


                <h3>2.1.5. Threat Level</h3>
<p>If an opponent’s level is higher than the character’s level, the player adds the difference between the two 
levels to the d20 when making any attribute tests to attack (if the character’s level is higher, no modifier is applied).</p>

                <h3>2.1.6. Weapons and damage</h3>
<p>Characters are trained fighters: the damage they cause with any weapon is the same (normally 1d6). Their unarmed
 damage is 1d4. These may change with Backgrounds (p. 24) and Gifts (p. 31).</p>
                
                <h3>2.1.7. Armour</h3>
<p>The armour’s protection rating is subtracted from the incoming damage (which can be reduced to zero).</p>

                <h3>2.1.8. Shields</h3>
<p>Shields give you Advantage to your defence tests when parrying. At the GM’s discretion, they may let you use
your STR to defend against arrows. A critical failure means the shield is broken.</p>

                <h3>2.1.9. Two-Handed Weapons</h3>
<p>These weapons give you Advantage to their damage rolls.</p>

                <h3>2.1.10. Attack Effect</h3><br>
<p>If you want to add an effect to your attack, say so before you make your attribute test and then make a Doom roll. 
        NPCs don’t have access to weapon effects.</p>
<p>• Break: you break your opponent’s weapon (or a piece of equipment).<br>
• Brutal: add the Doom die’s result to the damage you inflict.<br>
• Disarm: you do no damage, but your target is disarmed.<br>
• Entangle: you do no damage, all further attacks against the target during this Turn are done with Advantage.<br>
• Flurry: inflict regular damage and immediately get an additional attack.<br>
• Pin down: inflict regular damage and your target cannot move this Turn.<br>
• Sacrifice: inflict double damage (triple if your attack is a critical hit) but your weapon breaks.<br>
• Shove: you do no damage but push your opponent (to the ground, overboard, etc.).<br>
• Sweep: damage everyone Close to you (friend and foe).<br>
• Vicious: inflict regular and ongoing damage (Ud4).</p>

                <h3> 2.1.11. Ongoing Damage</h3>
<p>Things like acid, poison, or fire deal ongoing damage. Roll for damage using a Usage die (generally Ud4 or Ud6) 
each Turn until the die is depleted. There should always be ways to stop the damage, like jump in water to douse the 
flames or apply anti-venom unguent.</p>

                <h3>2.1.12. Hit Points</h3>
<p>When a monster’s or NPC’s hit points reach 0, they are dead. At 0 hit points a character is Helpless,

        <h2>2.2. Recovery</h2>
<p>As soon as they opted for a life of violence, characters have shown an unnatural capacity to heal. 
It is said that the powers of Law and Chaos tend to favour those who fit into their plans. Anyone 
witnessing the PCs’ unnatural healing grows suspicious of them. People associated with the powers 
that be usually bring bad luck and death with them... In game terms, it simply means player characters 
recover HP by taking a short rest or a long rest. Everyone else needs medical attention and several 
weeks of bed rest.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="col-6 col-12-small">  

<p>• Short rests can be taken anywhere: they last 1 hour, characters recover a number of hit points equal 
to half their CON score (rounded down). A character can take one short rest per day.<br>
• Long rests can only be taken in safe environments: they last 6 hours, and characters recover all 
their hit points. Their Doom dice are fully restored as well. Some backgrounds and gifts may require 
a long rest to refresh. This is mentioned in their description (see p. 24 and p. 31).</p>

<p>What counts as a safe environment is up to the GM. It is usually a settlement of some kind with some 
degree of provided comfort. A campsite in the wilderness, where night attacks or interruptions are a 
possibility, is never a safe environment. You shouldn’t expect to have long rests while in the wild.</p>

        <h2>2.3. Combat Example</h2>


<p>Let us join two level 1 heroes, Morgelt and Akem as they face four cultists who don’t seem to be open 
to negotiation.</p>


                <blockquote>
<p>
<b>GM:</b> Make your wisdom rolls!<br>
<b>Morgelt:</b> Success!<br>
<b>Akem:</b> I must be doomed: 19!<br>
<b>GM:</b> Ok you’ll only get one action on this first round. Morgelt you go first what do you do?<br>
<b>Morgelt:</b> I charge them! Do I get a bonus?<br>
<b>GM:</b> You’re too close, roll your attack.They’re level 2, so you add 1 to your attack roll. <br>
<b>Morgelt:</b> Success! I roll for damage...6!<br>
<b>GM:</b> This cultist bites the dust, how did you do it?<br>
<b>Morgelt:</b> Uh, I guess I just crushed his head with my mace.<br>
<b>GM:</b> Now it’s my turn, one of the cultists tries to stab you, how do you defend: parry or dodge?<br>
<b>Morgelt:</b> Parry and it’s a success!<br>
<b>GM:</b> Akem, two cultists go for you, how do you defend?<br>
<b>Akem:</b> I dodge, my Strength score is crap.<br>
<b>GM:</b> Ok, roll twice [one against each cultists] Once again, you get +1 to the roll [as the cultists are level 2].<br>
<b>Akem:</b> One success and one failure...<br>
<b>GM:</b> One of the cultists successfully stabs you, you lose 3 HP. Akem it’s your turn, you only get one 
action this time because of your crappy initiative roll.<br>
<b>Akem:</b> Yeah I rolled a 1! That’s called karma, I stab this guy in the face!<br>
<b>GM:</b> Your damage die is a d6 so you do 6, plus another d6... You got a 5? That’s 11 total, 
more than enough to kill this guy.<br>
New round of combat, Morgelt, you’re up!<br>
<b>Morgelt:</b> I attack twice, so I have to roll my Doom die first yes?<br>
<b>GM:</b> Exactly. You attack the same cultist twice?<br>
<b>Morgelt:</b> No, one attack is against the cultist attacking me the other one is against 
the one that is still attacking Akem if he’s close enough.<br>
<b>GM:</b> Yeah I guess you can [the GM thinks it’s not unreasonable, and it makes the fight more dynamic].<br>
<b>Morgelt:</b> First my Doom die: I rolled a 4, I’m fine, I roll my two attacks: two successes, I roll damage I get a 1 and a 5.<br>
<b>GM:</b> You only scratched the one facing you but killed the other one. It’s his turn, he’s attacking you.<br>
<b>Morgelt:</b> I roll a parry and, fail, crap.<br>
<b>GM:</b> You take 3 points of damage. Akem it’s your turn.<br>
<b>Akem:</b> Hey! We’re both attacking this guy, don’t I get an advantage?<br>
<b>GM:</b> Well, no, you didn’t get a disadvantage when they were both attacking you?<br>
Akem_Fair enough. I roll to attack and it’s a success! I roll damage: 4!<br>
<b>GM:</b> They were already 1 HP, now they’re seriously wounded. They drop their weapon and beg for mercy. What do you do? <br>
<b>Morgelt:</b> Let’s take them prisoner. Maybe they’ll give us some information about what’s beyond this room in exchange for their life. <br>
<b>Akem:</b> Alright. But this was our first fight and I already lost 30% of my HP... Are you sure we should go on?<br>
<b>Morgelt:</b> Next time there will be more of them, and they’ll be waiting for us, we push forward. I have some healing balms in my rucksack.

<p>Creating a character is a three-step process: the player rolls their character’s attributes, picks an origin and finally chooses backgrounds.</p>
        

 
 
<div class="row">
 
        <div class="col-6 col-12-small"> 
        <h2>3.1. Attributes</h2>
<p>A character is made of six attributes.</p>
<p>• Strength (STR) - Raw physical power. Use STR to... Bash skulls, parry, perform feats of brawn.</p>
<p>• DEXTERITY (DEX) - Deftness and agility. Use DEX to... Shoot people in the face, dodge, ride, pick locks.</p>
<p>• CONSTITUTION (CON) - The body’s capacity to resist physical stress. Use CON when... Resisting fatigue, poison, or diseases, etc.</p>
<p>• INTELLIGENCE (INT) - The ability to apply one’s knowledge to the situation at hand. Use INT when... Deciphering a dusty tome, looking for an enemy’s weakness or the exit to a maze.</p>
<p>• WISDOM (WIS) - Steadiness in a stressful situation. Use WIS for... Initiative, overcoming fear, and resisting mental stress.</p>
<p>• CHARISMA (CHA) - A measure of a character’s ability to influence others. Use CHA to... Persuade or intimidate NPCs.</p>

        <h2>3.2. Origin</h2>
<p>Pick one of the following origins for your character: Barbarian, Civilised, or Decadent. We use these words loosely, the way they were in pulp novels: a barbarian hero may value honour and courage but might easily succumb to violence and superstition.</p>
<p>A character coming from a civilised culture can cherish knowledge and progress but also be quick to deem others inferior or primitive. Decadent adventurers come from a doomed society, which could make them gloomy and miserable or carefree, just happy to survive another day. </p>
<p>A character’s origin is meant to springboard your imagination, not to turn your character into a cliché.</p>

                <h2 id="dark">6. Dark Pacts & Other Vileness</h2>
        </header>

<p>Signing a pact with immortal creatures made of deviousness, rage and hatred? You’re welcome to try. Such bargains tend to blur the line between master and servant. Whatever your original intentions, working with demons and practising magic means you’ll be serving Chaos in the end.</p>

<p>Use Responsibly: The game gives you rules for sorcery, demon pacts, spirit alliances, faerie ties, and twisted science. This doesn’t mean you have to include them all! Choosing only a couple will make your campaign more strongly themed. Some powers may also be mastered by NPCs only (sorcery jumps to mind here). And of course, ask your players if they have preferences!</p>


        <hr class="major"> 

<div class="row">
        <div class="col-6 col-12-small">
        
        <h2>6.1. Demonic Pacts</h2>
<p>Characters with the Warlock background have two demons at their service  (choose their types opposite). Demons are associated with Chaos but have no trouble serving someone aligned with Law or Balance.</p>
            
            <h2>6.1.1. Invoking a Demon Power</h2>
<p>Roll your Doom die, with Disadvantage if it isn’t the first time you summon a demon today (this resets after a long rest). If the Doom Usage die is depleted while invoking a demon, roll on the Demon’s revenge table below. Additionally, if the Doom die rolls a 1, there is a side effect (detailed in the demon’s description).</p>
            
            <h2>6.1.2. DEMON’S REVENGE (D6)</h2>
            <ul>
<li>1. You cannot invoke this demon until the next sunrise</li>
<li>2. The demon steals one of your possessions</li>
<li>3. The demon destroys a weapon  belonging to one of your allies</li>
<li>4. The demon pays itself in blood: lose d6 HP</li>
<li>5. Broken pact: you cannot invoke this particular demon ever again</li>
<li>6. The demon appears and inflicts you 3d6 damage before wandering off. The pact is broken (as above)</li>
             </ul>



            <h2>6.1.3. Demon Manifestation</h2>
<p>As a rule, demons are never seen, as they don’t need to appear physically to influence their targets. Demonic magic is insidious, drawing its strength from the weaknesses of its victims. The name of the summoned demon must be clearly spoken by the warlock.</p>
            
        </div>
        <div class="col-6 col-12-small">

            <h2>6.1.4. Creating a New Pact</h2>
<p>It is of course possible for a character to form a pact with a demon during play. It always should be arduous and the result of a dangerous adventure or quest.</p>



            <h2>6.1.5. How To Find The Demon You Seek</h2>
            <ul>
<li>1. By killing its master, a prominent figure in this town</li>
<li>2. In a well, posing as a divining spirit,spreading awful rumours</li>
<li>3. In the queen’s secret jewel cabinet</li>
<li>4. Hidden inside a map, on the shelves of a forgotten library</li>
<li>5. Inside a small gem owned by a clueless noble</li>
<li>6. In a cup used by a cult to drug their acolytes</li>
<li>7. In the memories of an amnesiac Chaos priest</li>
<li>8. In the broken sword of a banished Templar</li>
<li>9. Trapped in the wedding ring of an undying king</li>
<li>10. In a cryptic tome, sealed by another demon</li>
<li>11. In the breastplate of a dead knight left on a battlefield</li>
<li>12. Inside a stone circle, ready to serve whoever can best it in a duel. 	</li>
<li>13. Haunting the castle where its last master was murdered	</li>
<li>14. Enslaved by a powerful oracle</li>
<li>15. Inside the heathen reliquary that releases it once per month</li>
<li>16. Carved on the gravestone of an emperor</li>
<li>17. Inside the only toy owned by an orphan</li>
<li>18. In the liver of the Inquisitor it is possessing	</li>
<li>19. Hidden in its castle, on a nightmarish demonic plane</li>
<li>20. In the mouth of a dead dragon, guarded by superstitious locals</li>

            <ul>
<li><b>Abyss</b>
The target becomes monstrous, misshapen, or disfigured; an object of fear and disgust for the next d6 hours. On a roll of 1 the effect is permanent.</li>
<li><b>Envy</b>
The target tries to take a specific object of your choosing that is in its sight, by force if necessary. On a roll of 1, the object is a piece of your equipment.</li>
<li><b>Fear </b>
You learn your target’s deepest fear. On a roll of 1, they learn your deepest fear as well.</li>
<li><b>Greed</b>
Creates 4d6 fake coins that will revert to their natural state (beans, rocks, whatever you had on hand) within one hour. On a roll of 1, the demon steals 4d6 coins from you (or your allies) as well.</li>
<li><b>Hate</b>
Your target verbally abuses someone of your choosing for d6 minutes. On a roll of 1, you shout insults at your target as well.</li>
<li><b>Isolation </b>
No one seems to care about the target: it can’t be heard or seen for d6 hours. On a roll of 1, you cannot see them either.</li>
<li><b>Gluttony </b>
Your target attacks (randomly selected) people and tries to eat them. It stops when they have eaten 2d6 HP worth of people. On a roll of 1, the target wants to eat you.</li>
<li><b>Nightmare </b>
The target loses sleep for the night: all attribute tests made against them have Advantage on the following day. On a roll of 1, anger takes over and tests against the target are made with Disadvantage instead.</li>
<li><b>Oblivion </b>
The target disappears from everyone’s memories for the next d6 hours. On a roll of 1, the demon steals one Background from you as well. You will recover it after a long rest.</li>
<li><b>Ruin </b>
Breaks a piece of equipment which can be up to the size of a cart. On a roll of 1, a piece of your own gear breaks as well.</li>
<li><b>Sloth</b>
The target falls asleep. On a roll of 1, they never wake up.</li>
<li><b>Suspicion</b>
Choose someone in sight as the object of your target’s suspicions. On a roll of 1 you become the centre of the target’s attention.</li>
<li><b>Wrath </b>
The target becomes berserk and attacks everyone in sight, seeking to inflict pain rather than kill. On a roll of 1, you are affected as well.</li>
            </ul>

         </div>
        <div class="col-6 col-12-small">

            <h2>6.1.7. Free-Form Demonism</h2>
<p>GMs should be open to players using demon invocation in a more open-ended way, using the above effects as mere guidelines. They should just keep the following principles in mind: demons reinforce or exacerbate the worst traits of their targets. The tricky part is coming up with a backlash when the player gets 1 on the Doom roll. As a baseline, the effects of the demon’s influence become permanent (especially for innocuous powers) or they affect the warlock as well (well suited for offensive powers).</p>

        <h2>6.2. Spirit Alliances</h2>
<p>The spirit world is one parallel to our own: demons don't exist there. Spirits represent the raw power of nature: animals, storms, savagery... They're not aligned with any specific power. You can find Law, Balance, and Chaos in nature. Characters who have the Shaman background have two spirits at their service. Choose them from the list below.</p>

            
            <h2>6.2.1. Calling a Spirit</h2>
<p>Roll your Doom die, with Disadvantage if it isn't the first time you have summoned a spirit today (this resets after a long rest). Spirit use is more open-ended than any other type of power. Each spirit has its own guidelines; the goal is to help players make good use of their powers without going overboard.</p>
 


            <h2>6.2.2. Spirit Types</h2>
            <ul>
<li><b>Ancestor spirit </b>
The wise counsel of an ancestor gives you Advantage to one attribute test. You must possess an object that belonged to the ancestor to be able to summon them. On a roll of 1 the ancestor disapproves of your action and gives you Disadvantage instead. </li>
<li><b>Animal lord spirit</b>
All animal species have an animal lord: a being representing all the qualities that animal possesses See them as the "ultimate" version of an animal. The animal lord's subjects come to your help (but do not risk their lives doing so) or stop attacking you. On a roll of 1 the animals flee (or attack you if they are predators).</li>
<li><b>Disease spirit</b>
The target is plagued with a non-lethal but debilitating disease, forcing them to be bedridden until a proper cure is found. On a roll of 1 the disease is contagious. Fire spirit An existing fire can be manipulated: doubled in size, given any shape or form, moved around, etc. It can inflict d6 damage (and then Ud6 ongoing damage). A roll of 1 makes the target fire die</li>
<li><b>Forest spirit</b>
This spirit can help you find your way, food, water, or shelter when you're in a forest (or jungle or whatever wild environment you have in your campaign). It can also summon plants that will hinder your enemies (Advantage on attribute tests against them for one turn). A roll of 1 means the spirit makes sure you  have a miserable time: no short or long rest for the next two days.</li>
<li><b>Hunger spirit</b>
The target immediately searches for food and water and will not stop until it has eaten a full meal. A roll of 1 means the shaman is affected as well. </li>
<li><b>Pain spirit </b>
Causing pain that prevents the target from acting for one Turn is a common use of this spirit. A roll of 1 means the shaman is afflicted at the same time. </li>
<li><b>River spirit</b>
Water must be present and, as with a fire spirit, it can be manipulated in many ways: doubled in size, shaped, moved around, etc. On a roll of 1, the target body of water disappears. </li>
<li><b>Wind spirit</b>
This spirit can be invoked to extinguish flames, dissipate toxic fumes, or even force humanoids to the ground. A result of 1 has the opposite effect: flames are fanned, toxic fumes move towards the shaman, etc.</li>
                </ul>
            
        </div>
        <div class="col-6 col-12-small">


            <h2>6.2.3. Sacrificing a Spirit Alliance</h2>
<p>A shaman can choose to sacrifice its relationship with a spirit to be granted a huge effect: create a firestorm, create a hurricane, summon a beast lord in the flesh. As a consequence, the shaman will be shunned by spirits of this type and denied any further alliances.</p>
            
            <h2>6.2.4. Creating a New Pact</h2>
<p>If you encounter or summon a spirit, you can attempt to bind it. There will always be a price.</p>
            




            <h2>6.2.5. What Price Does the Spirit Ask For?</h2>
            <ul>
<li>1. Destroy another spirit</li>
<li>2. Bind the spirit to your main weapon</li>
<li>3. Destroy a specific building (windmill, dam, sawmill...)</li>
<li>4. Make a pilgrimage in the spirit world</li>
<li>5. Bring the corpse of a shaman to hallowed grounds</li>
<li>6. Free it from another alliance</li>
<li>7. Permanently lose 1 hit point to seal the alliance</li>
<li>8. Renounce an alliance with another spirit</li>
<li>9. Imprison another spirit</li>
<li>10. Use it to kill a cult leader</li>
<li>11. Stop a creature that feeds on spirits</li>
<li>12. Let it feed on the enemies you kill</li>
<li>13. Close a gate to the spirit world</li>
<li>14. Follow a specific rule (don't eat meat, wear red, no alcohol, etc.)</li>
<li>15. Stop a disease spreading through the spirit world etc.)</li>
<li>16. Free an animal used as a pet by the local ruler</li>
<li>17. Let it possess your body for one day</li>

<p>Sorcery is Chaos using humans as conduits and letting them think they’re in control. Of course, bending reality to your will has a price, but you are ready to let others pay it for you. Characters with the Forbidden knowledge background start with 4 randomly selected spells. Roll d100 on the list below.</p>
            
            <h2>6.3.1. Casting a Spell</h2>

            <h2>6.3.6. Finding and Learning New Spells</h2>
<p>Spells are tools of power, sorcerers don’t leave them lying around. Finding a new spell is an adventure in and of itself. Once you have the spell’s formula, the item it is mystically bonded to, or a mentor to teach it to you, make an INT roll. A failure means you have to find another version of the spell and a critical failure means you can never learn this specific spell.</p>


            <h2>6.3.7. Where is That Spell?</h2>
<ul>    
<li>1. In the hands of an entombed queen waiting to be awoken.</li>
<li>2. Hidden in a treasure map that leads to a trap. </li>
<li>3. Engraved on the bones of an ever living mummy. </li>
<li>4. In a block of ice, inside a long forgotten city waiting to rise again. 	</li>
<li>5. In the hideout of a bloodthirsty gang.</li>
<li>6. In an underwater temple guarded by ghost sharks.</li>
<li>7. In the bag of a sorcerer’s apprentice who murdered their master.	</li>
<li>8. Half of the spell was sent to you with an invitation to a distant castle.</li>
<li>9. In a bookshop located in a besieged city.</li>
<li>10.	On a sacrificial blade owned by a remorseful priest.</li>
<li>11.	In the hold of a pirate ship with the rest of the loot.</li>
<li>12.	In the hands of a skeleton, the latest victim of the Fanged Forest. 	</li>
<li>13. A voice in your head says “Spill the blood of a friend on a black stone slab”.</li>
<li>14.	Engraved on top of a pillar said to reach to the heavens.</li>
<li>15.	Encoded in the text of a lost play that turns its audience into monsters.</li>
<li>16.	Tattooed on the backs of its conceptor’s three children.</li>
<li>17.	In the cellar of a retired inquisitor.</li>
<li>18.	Hidden inside your mind, revealed when you’re down to 0 HP.</li>
<li>19.	Hidden in a painting that gives nightmares to most people.</li>
<li>20.	On a moon, near the wreck of a strange ship.</li>

            <h2>6.4. Faerie Ties</h2>
<p>The Changeling background lets players choose two ties with the realms of Faerie. New ties can be made during play at the GM’s discretion</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Barrow wisdom</b>
You learned some rudimentary necromancy. You can speak with the dead, provided either their body or soul is nearby. The dead are rarely cooperative. They may demand a price, but you can also attempt to force them to do something or answer a question (WIS test required, decrease your Doom die).</li>
<li><b>Cauldron of gold</b>
You own a magical gold bezant (worth 100 coins) that always finds its way back to your purse after 1d8 dawns. It is part of a treasure of immense value towards which it could lead you, if only you knew the right charm...</li>
<li><b>Changeling knowledge</b>
As a human adopted by the fey, you learned all about (choose two): hunting and tracking, history and myth, courtly manners and intrigue, philosophy and metaphysics, strategy and tactics, metallurgy and mining, or some other subject (with the GM’s approval). Roll with Advantage when making a test relevant to your area of expertise.</li>
<li><b>Cold iron weapon</b>
You inherited, stole, or otherwise came into the possession of a legendary blade. It has a name and a legend, perhaps also a dark prophecy. It deals an extra d6 damage to all denizens of faerie.</li>
<li><b>Doomed to greatness</b>
Once per day, you can roll your Doom die with Advantage. After you do so, it takes 1d3 long rests to go back to its maximum.</li>
<li><b>Dwarf deceit</b>
You get Advantage when lying or sneaking with the intention to do harm. </li>
<li><b>Elfin secret</b>
You learned how to (choose): speak to birds, make plants obey a one-word command, become invisible to mortals, enthral a lover, divine one’s most secret desire, make (non-aggressive) mortals tremble with fear. If you use this secret more than once per day, roll your Doom.</li>
<li><b>Silversmith sorcerer</b>
Your master taught you how to weave spells into your jewellery. Roll for two spells from page 40. You know how to bind them to one of your creations at the cost of 1d6 x 100 coins and 3d6 days of work. The bearer of one of your items can cast the spell as if they were a sorcerer.</li>
<li><b>Skinwalker</b>
You know the spells needed to turn into an animal while wearing a specially prepared pelt. You can own two of these pelts at any time.</li>
<li><b>Trollish ruggedness</b>
Add +1 to the protection of any type of armour you wear.</li>
<li><b>True faith</b>
You know how to fight the fey with fire, faith, and iron. Roll your Doom die to dispel one magical effect of fey origin. </li>
<li><b>Witchsight</b>
You can see through the veil that hides the realms of faerie. Elves, trolls, and other magical beings are always visible to you. You may be able to see magical auras and detect illusions with a successful WIS roll. </li>

        <h2>6.5. Twisted Science</h2>
<p>Human ingenuity can produce wonderful gadgets and terrifying weapons. A character with the Inventor background can make the world a better place or burn it to the ground.</p>

            <h2>6.5.1. Building a Marvel</h2>
<p>Your character makes gadgets and other devices using invention points. You get as many invention points as your INT score at the beginning of the week. The cost of each marvel is indicated in brackets after its name. You must have access to a well equipped workshop to build a marvel. Your invention points reset at the beginning of each week.</p>

            <h2>6.5.2. Maintenance</h2>
<p>Subtract half the cost of your gadgets that are still active from the invention points you get each week. The good news is you don’t need a workshop to do maintenance work.</p>

            <h2>6.5.3. Gadget Costs</h2>
<p>You also need some materials to build your gadgets. As a rule of thumb, each marvel requires 20 coins worth of materials per invention point required. Same goes for the maintenance...</p>

            <h2>6.5.4. Usage Die</h2>
<p>Unless they are single use items, your 
creations come with a Ud6. Roll it after each use (or after a fight for weapons).</p>

                </div>
              <div class="col-6 col-12-small">

            <h2>6.5.5. Twisted Science Marvels</h2>
            <ul>
<li><b>Acid spray [2]:</b> An enemy’s weapon damage die is automatically downgraded by one step.</li>
<li><b>Blood-tinted spyglass [4]:</b> The user can see any living being (with blood in their veins), even those hiding behind cover or in darkness.</li>
<li><b>Bomb [4] [Single-use]:</b> D8 damage to anyone Nearby. A critical failure means the bomb explodes near you.</li>
<li><b>Firelance [6]:</b> As the name implies, a ranged weapon that spits fire at your enemies. Add Ud4 ongoing damage to a successful attack.</li>
<li><b>Freezing warhammer [6]:</b> Freezes any non-living matter it hits. Frozen objects are easy to shatter. On a roll of 20, when using the warhammer, the wielder suffers d6 frost damage and the hammer is destroyed.</li>
<li><b>Gas mask [2]:</b> You’ll excuse us if we don’t follow the traditions of RPG writing and don’t feel the need to always state the obvious: you know what a gas mask does.</li>
<li><b>Hallucinogenic gas [4] [Single-use]:</b> Indoors only. Roll a d6 for every person in the room, 1-2: relaxed state making the target easy to influence, 3-5: vivid dreams, making users oblivious to anything happening around them, 6: nightmarish visions, lots of panicking and screaming.</li>
<li><b>Image crystal [4]:</b> A small crystal that projects a human-sized (or smaller) image of your choosing. The image must be decided when you build the crystal.</li>
<li><b>Metal Owl [4]:</b> An owl automaton that can follow simple orders (up to six words). It has 4 HP and can distract a foe but cannot attack.</li>
<li><b>Prosthetic limb [10]:</b> No Usage die needed. Works as the original. Can be sacrificed to negate the damage from one attack.</li>
<li><b>Resurrection shot [4] [Single-use]:</b> The target doesn’t have to roll on the Helpless table (page 18) but needs to roll a d20. On a result of 20, they die (probably in a gruesome way).</li>
<li><b>Sleep box [4]:</b> A music box that plunges every living creature hearing its melody into a trance. The Usage die roll tells you how long the effect lasts (in minutes).</li>
<li><b>Targeting monocle [4]:</b> Lets you ignore any penalties on your ranged attack rolls (including those related to your target’s level).</li>
<li><b>Terror gas grenade [2] [Single-use]:</b> Roll a d6 for anyone breathing it. 1-4: they flee in terror, 5-6: they go berserk and add d4 to their damage.</li>
<li><b>Truth serum [4] [Single-use]:</b> Once injected with the serum, they tell everything they know. Roll a d20. On a result of 15-20, the target dies before they can speak.</li>

            <h2>6.5.6. Creating New Objects</h2>
<p>Steampunk novels, movies and animes are a great source of twisted science gadgets. Take 19th century and early 20th century items then add a dash of madness: X-ray goggles, two-way radios communicating with the dead, trench lightning gun,  flashbang marbles, etc.</p>


                </div>
              <div class="col-6 col-12-small">
        <h2>6.6. Runic Weapons</h2>
<p>Runic weapons are very powerful and extremely dangerous. They should be extremely rare, probably no more than two in your whole campaign world. These sentient weapons relish the pain they inflict to others but enjoy the suffering of their wielder even more.</p>
<p>From the above, it should be obvious that runic weapons are usually associated with Chaos, though exceptions may exist in your world. Legends say that runic weapons are the result of the fusion of a blade and its wielder, often a champion of Chaos, Law, or Balance. Followers of Law and Balance usually dislike the idea of becoming immortal, even in such a way.</p>
<p>A runic weapon has an Intelligence score (rolled the same way it is for characters, see p. 10). The GM makes an INT test for the weapon at the beginning of each session. If successful, the weapon will kill the 
character if they ever become helpless during that session. At the GM’s discretion, the weapon can take the life of an important NPC instead.</p>

<p>A runic weapon can talk to its wielder through telepathy. The GM can do it but if the table agrees, a player can play the role of another’s weapon. Players cannot “act” with the weapon in any way, but they can speak to the wielder now and then. The goal is to make sure the weapon has a personality that contributes to the story, not to make your friends’ lives miserable.</p>

<p>The weapon inflicts damage equal to one of the wielder’s attributes, which gives a hint about the weapon’s personality.</p>

<ul>
<li>1. STR (brutal, always calling for action)</li>
<li>2. DEX (vicious, often mocking the wielder)</li>
<li>3. CON (patient, treating the wielder as a child)</li>
<li>4. INT (cunning and distrustful, encouraging suspicion)</li>
<li>5. WIS (judgemental, always second guessing the wielder’s decisions)</li>
<li>6. CHA (prideful, pushing the wielder to be more ambitious)</li>
</ul>

<p>The weapon seems to be made of.... (d12)</p>

            <h3>7.1.1. Armoured Opponents</h3> 
To avoid unnecessary arithmetics, simply add a few HP: 2 (light armour), 3 (medium armour) or 4 (Full plate or equivalent).

            <h3>7.1.2. Vulnerability & Resistance</h3> 
A vulnerability means attackers get Advantage on their damage roll while resistance means they get Disadvantage on damage. Popular choices include fire, frost, lightning, Chaotic or Lawful attackers, etc.

Aside from the most die-hard fanatics, human antagonists will surrender or flee if they have less than 3 HP left or if they lose half of their forces. Same goes if the characters use runic weapons, magic, demons, or spirits against unsuspecting foes (and this may affect the characters’ reputation as well).

No need to roll for every corpse the PCs find (or make).</p>

<p>Each group playing Black Sword Hack creates its own setting. This chapter contains the tools to help you build the worlds you will destroy. </p>



        <h3>8.1. Law and Chaos in Your World </h3>
<p>At the centre of it all is the struggle between the forces of Law and Chaos. Thanks to decades of arguments over the nature and relevance of alignment in fantasy games, or simply the reading of Poul Anderson and Michael Moorcock’s books, you know as well as we do that these two don’t stand for good and evil. </p>
<p>A society dominated by Law could be characterised as stable and well-organised, but these same qualities can make it repressive, stagnant, and rigid. A society dominated by Chaos can be seen as dynamic, diverse, and thriving but also be subject to vast inequalities, internal strife, and an unhealthy appetite for conquest. </p>

            <h3>8.1.1. Is the main antagonist tied to the forces of Law?</h3> 
<ul>            
<li>1. A dying Empress floating in a vat of regenerative fluids</li>
<li>2. A network of brains enclosed in runic bronze casings</li>

<p>When it comes to describing the villain’s forces, there’s no need for subtlety. They’ll be the characters main enemies, or at least a looming threat: patrolling city streets, hunting down dissidents, and the subject of scary bedtime stories.</p>

        <h3>8.2. The Struggle</h3>
<p>Now it’s time to define who is resisting, who is collaborating, and who has the luxury to do neither. The character creation chapter hints at a few political entities: use them to loosely define your setting and add your own. Some of your players will also come up with interesting ideas for their character’s origin. Draw (or print out)  a blank map and write down the name of each nation or region you plan to use initially, paying attention to geographical borders and the relationships these dictate. The rest can always come up later.</p>
<p>Take a blank map and note the name of each place as you see fit:<br>
Forbidden City • Mercenary bands • Amber Enclave • Golden Archipelago • Northern Raiders • Merchant League • Flotsam Kingdom • Eastern Principalities • Pict Territories • Iron Horde • Land of the Black Pyramids • Grey Spires Dominion • The last city of a dying species • City of Thieves • Theocracy • Dust Empire</p>

<p>Then, you can determine the political situation of some of the nations (five or six) and their attitude towards Law and Chaos by rolling a d6 on these tables:</p>

        <h3>8.4. Regional Adventure Seeds</h3>
<p>Here you’ll find a list of events the characters could get involved in as well as a few questions that will help define your world.</p>



 <hr class="major"> 
<div class="row">
 
        <div class="col-6 col-12-small">


            <h3>8.4.1. Forbidden City</h3>
<p>Why is the city forbidden? Are the reasons religious or political? Both? Is the City quarantined?</p>
<ul> 	 	
<li>1}- There is a way to enter the Forbidden City via the spirit world. A spirit guide must be found to lead the way. Also, the portal leads into the City’s distant past, when it was the capital of a ruthless empire.</li>
<li>2}- A vast army secretly plans to conquer the Forbidden City and the heroes hear of it. What will they do with this information?</li>
<li>3}- All noble families must send their firstborn to work as a scribe in the Forbidden City. Some refuse and hire adventurers to bring their child back.</li>
<li>4}- An angel appears above the city, proclaiming it will be destroyed in one moon. Finding more about this angel will be generously rewarded (the right to enter the City or even citizenship).</li>
<li>5}- The Forbidden City grants citizenship to anyone bringing a unique grimoire.</li>
<li>6}- The true master of the City dies, and a replacement must be found quickly without the authorities finding out. Hiring outsiders will help keep things discreet.</li>
</ul>
                
        </div>
        <div class="col-6 col-12-small">

            <h3>8.4.2. Mercenary Bands</h3>
<p>Is there room for freelancers or is the business fully controlled by large companies? Which companies stand out?</p>

<ul>
<li>1}- Signing up for mercenary work while drunk was a bad idea. Especially when one is surrounded and about to get crushed by the opposing army.</li>
<li>2}- A new mercenary band made of automatons shows up, offering to work cheaply. Where does it come from, and who leads it? Worried mercenary captains want to know.</li>
<li>3}- To reach a position of power and wealth, a mercenary captain sells out their warband. Survivors seek revenge.</li>
<li>4}- Some villagers approach the characters to hire them. The job is to protect the village against mercenary raids. If you have seven players, it’s even better.</li>
<li>5}- Mercenaries decide to create an independent state. This doesn’t go too well with the neighbours, though some already plot to use this to their advantage.</li>
<li>6}- The campaign’s main antagonist decides to disband and ban all companies. But mercenaries won’t go down without a fight.</li>

            <h3>8.4.3. Amber Enclave</h3>
<p>When did the enclave appear? Why doesn’t anyone invade it?</p>
<ul>
<li>1}- It is said the Amber enclave was created by beings from another dimension. Many scholars would pay well for any information on the subject.</li>
<li>2}- A sorcerer took refuge here to experiment with opening a portal to the future, hoping to escape the world’s end and find whatever is next.</li> 
<li>3}- A fugitive hunted by the enclave’s enforcers tells a wild story: one of the enclave’s portals keeps growing at an alarming rate after an experiment gone wrong. It threatens to engulf the whole country. Ways to stop it include killing the portal’s creator and/or going through it.</li>
<li>4}- The golden apgarian: a plant with extraordinary healing abilities (it replaces lost limbs with moss and wood) grows only in the Amber enclave. It is guarded by nature spirits who ask for payment (see the spirits table on p. 37).</li>
<li>5}- One of the enclave’s rulers has been kidnapped by a neighbouring country. Mercenaries are needed to bring them back.</li>
<li>6}- Scholars think the Amber enclave hides many portals leading to many places in the world. The Amber enclave’s rulers allow their use in exchange for some service.</li>
</ul>
        
        </div>
        <div class="col-6 col-12-small">

            <h3>8.4.4. Golden Archipelago</h3>
<p>Is the Golden Archipelago made of islands floating in the sky instead of an ocean? What unites the islands? Do they call it like this because it is so wealthy?</p> 
<ul>
<li>1}- A relic from a past civilisation, the Silac Umbar, is hidden in the archipelago. It is said that it can change a specific event in its bearer’s past.</li>
<li>2}- A storm threatens to engulf the whole archipelago. A new island appears, stopping the storm but immediately unleashing dragons to conquer the region. </li>
<li>3}- A cult turns the crews of lost ships into loathsome human-insect hybrids to dig into the island their ancient god is imprisoned in.</li>
<li>4}- Once a year, a fog engulfs one of the islands, allowing the living to speak with the dead. The characters will be visited by old enemies and lost friends. </li>
<li>5}- During a thunderstorm, the characters’ ship is struck by lightning: they’re now out of phase and appear as ghosts, becoming the target of every undead spirit. To return to their world the PCs have to find the witch who summoned the storm in the first place.</li>
<li>6}- One of the islands is home to a creature that absorbs the life of those who try to live on it. It’s starting to suck the life of neighbouring islands as well. Finding a way to stop this will lead the heroes to confront the mighty vampiric spirit that possesses the island.</li>

            <h3>8.4.5. Northern Raiders</h3>
<p>Do they use ships? Airships? Submarines? Do they only attack at night, and why? Are there places they never attack for unknown reasons?</p>
<ul>
<li>1}- Prisoners get the following choice: be sold as a slave or become a raider. Picking the second option means pledging one’s life to a mysterious sea goddess. Break the vow and your lungs slowly fill with seawater.</li>
<li>2}- A Raider has visions of a golden city on the other side of the ocean. She seeks volunteers to mount an expedition. These dreams are a plea for help from a dying civilisation.</li>
<li>3}- Past victims of the raiders appear on ghost ships and hunt them down. The characters can try to find a way to lift the curse or prevent the raiders from doing so.</li>
<li>4}- A Raider chieftain has been captured and sits in a cell waiting for her execution. It’s time to break her out of the biggest prison ever built, Mörk Fängelse!</li>
<li>5}- The campaign’s main antagonist is trying to rally the Northern Raiders to its cause. Preventing such an alliance might be a good idea.</li>
<li>6}- Each year, Raider captains compete in a tournament. The winner takes the leadership of the Raiders for one year.</li>
</ul>

        </div>
        <div class="col-6 col-12-small">

            <h3>8.4.6. Merchant League</h3>
<p>The beating heart of the world’s commerce. Competition is fierce and leads to large amounts of political manoeuvring and backstabbing. How does the League protect its members? Demonic ships? Contracts sealed with sorcery? Cursed cargo for everyone but the owner?</p>
<ul>
<li>1}- A trio of old pirates vowed to take revenge against a Merchant League privateer. They need agents in the League to plan their attack.</li>
<li>2}- Any merchant excluded by the League’s council loses all property rights: anyone can steal from them, whether it’s a ship or a box of silverware. This keeps most merchants in line but has led to many bloody “acquisitions”.</li>
<li>3}- A ruined merchant got his revenge: suddenly, gold eating imps are invading the League’s capital. Stopping the imps means finding a way to banish a powerful greed demon.</li>
<li>4}- A merchant House is gaining influence inside the League’s council. This is thanks to a corrupt haruspice working for the cult that took over the House. Their goal is to summon their god with the largest offering of gold ever seen.</li>
<li>5}- Fake coins appear all over the League’s markets. The coins can be traced to the campaign’s main villain. This could lead to the League’s ruin in a matter of weeks.</li>
<li>6}- One of the characters inherits the title of Honourable Merchant from a distant relation, granting them a place at the League’s council. What could go wrong?</li>
</ul>

            <h3>8.4.7. Flotsam Kingdom</h3>
<p>Is it floating in the air? On a sea of ice? Is there a myth around the kingdom’s creation, tales of the first Castaway? Who were the first inhabitants, escaped prisoners and slaves? People banished from their land?</p>
<ul>
<li>1}- The Kingdom’s divers explore the depths to find valuable objects from past civilisations. One of them has found the entrance to a vast submerged city. The heroes are the first to learn about this.</li>
<li>2}- The Kingdom is often raided by pirates led by the king’s sister. At the same time a small group of scholars, divers, and dockers wants to get rid of both and create a Flotsam Republic.</li>
<li>3}- The campaign’s main antagonist wants to annex the Flotsam Kingdom. Why would they go out of their way to conquer a floating nation?</li>
<li>4}- A leviathan asks for human sacrifices, or it will destroy the Kingdom. There’s probably a way to find its lair and banish it.</li>
<li>5}- Someone the characters are seeking has taken refuge in the Flotsam Kingdom. Nobody here likes strangers asking questions, unless they prove themselves to be trustworthy. Freeing workers from the king’s underwater dungeon would be a good start.</li>
<li>6}- The Kingdom’s security depends on driftwood golems. The ritual to control them has just been stolen. Whoever acquires it will have the Flotsam Kingdom’s fate in their hands.</li>
</ul>

        </div>
        <div class="col-6 col-12-small">

            <h3>8.4.8. Eastern Principalities</h3>
<p>A land of gothic horror, an analogue to China’s Warring Kingdoms, or a mix of both. What are vampires like in your world?</p>  
<ul>
<li>1}- Each Principality was ruled by a vampire until a family of monster hunters managed to kill most of them. Principalities still run by vampires seek revenge to this day.</li>
<li>2}- Each Principality maintains its own standing army. To face the cost, some of these troops have been working as mercenaries abroad for a long time. Some captains grab the power as soon as they return.</li>
<li>3}- A constant state of war causes regular food shortages. Smuggling grain and venison has become a lucrative business.</li>
<li>4}- A scholar has found a way to make human blood poisonous to vampires. She’s relentlessly tracked by the vampire princes. All she needs is the blood of the first vampire to devise her potion. From then, it will spread as a disease that only kills vampires.</li>
<li>5}- A monastic order knows the location of the first vampire. A number of monks each know one piece of the puzzle, and all must be found to get there.</li>
<li>6}- A vampire sorcerer manages to temporarily mask the sun over the Principalities, leading to a brutal war of conquest of the human towns. Finding the sorcerer and killing them is the only way to prevent the blood suckers from taking control of the region.</li>
</ul>
        </div>

 <hr class="major"> 
<div class="row">
 
        <div class="col-6 col-12-small">

            <h3>8.4.9. Pict Territories</h3>
<p>Why are they also called the Unconquered Lands? How did the Picts manage to repel all invaders so far? Have they made a pact with a particular power? Are they the land’s best warriors?</p>
<ul>
<li>1}- Undertaking a difficult spirit quest grants the survivor the authority to unite all the tribes. Failing the quest means death.</li>
<li>2}- A sacred relic, the spear of Alpia, was stolen by the campaign’s main antagonist. Finding the relic will reveal the treason of one of the Pict tribes.</li>
<li>3}- An old burial mound was recently pillaged by a group of foreign historians. Unknown to the clan is the fact that these objects can lead to a necropolis where the first king of the Picts was buried.</li>
<li>4}- Spirits across the Pict territories cease to serve shamans. The spirit world has been invaded by corrupted beings from another world.</li>
<li>5}- Pict farmers can cultivate supposedly barren lands. This is thanks to an ancient pact with Chaos. What would happen if the Picts decided to join the forces of Law?</li>
<li>6}- As punishment, Pict shamans transform criminals into animals and let hunters go after them. Once you recover your human form, the hunt is over.</li>
</ul>


        </div>
        <div class="col-6 col-12-small">


            <h3>8.4.10. Iron Horde</h3>
<p>What mounts does the Horde use? Was there a unifying figure to create the Horde? Do its people wish to settle down? Does it cause friction among clans ?</p>
<ul>
<li>1}- A fact unknown to outsiders is that Iron Horde mounts (whether they’re horses, griphons, or drakes) are of human intelligence. Each mount chooses its rider. Sometimes they pick outsiders for a specific quest.</li>
<li>2}- Vanquished enemies have used powerful magic to create the Horde’s undead counterpart. This could lead to the end of the Iron Horde.</li>
<li>3}- The Iron Horde sends spies and saboteurs to prepare the invasion of well-defended cities. They often hire outsiders for this kind of work.</li>
<li>4}- The Great Khan’s daughter has run away, hoping to explore the world. She’ll probably cross the characters’ path.</li>
<li>5}- In the middle of the Iron Horde’s territory is a bottomless pit in which traitors are thrown as punishment. The pit leads to an underground sea that flows into different planes, leading to many a strange place.</li>
<li>6}- The Eastern Principalities want to join forces with the Iron Horde to open a second front against the campaign’s antagonist. Traitors on both sides need the alliance to fail.</li>

            <h3>8.4.11. Land of the Black Pyramids</h3>
<p>The existence of the pyramids shows their creators were one of the most advanced civilisations (at least on a technical level) in the world. Why didn’t they conquer the rest of the world? Did they try and fail? Are they a still thriving culture or a dying one?</p>
<ul>
<li>1}- A gladiator revolt takes over the Seventh Pyramid, leading to slave revolts across the land. </li>
<li>2}- The world’s largest library is in the Fifth Pyramid. The answer to most questions can be found here, for a price: a spell, a spirit alliance, or a demonic pact. Bargains made here cannot be broken.</li>
<li>3}- The ruins of the Tenth Pyramid have just been discovered. No one knows it is full of plague demons eager to spread around the world. Stopping them will require the help of other spirits.</li>
<li>4}- The infernal scribes of the Third Pyramid can erase someone’s name from recent history. Everyone forgets having ever met this person, except those present during the ceremony. This is sometimes used as punishment by the Architects.</li>
<li>5}- An ancient sect guards the First Pyramid, said to contain the demon who almost destroyed the world. An enterprising group of thieves has just entered the place...</li>
<li>6}- There are rumours of an inverted pyramid built underground leading to a future, desolate version of the world. The place contains clues that might help avoid this cataclysmic fate.</li>
</ul>

        </div>
        <div class="col-6 col-12-small">


            <h3>8.4.12. Grey Spires Dominion</h3>
<p>What is the spires’ origin? Were they built by a long-forgotten civilisation? Were their creators even human? Are they still able to build new spires or was that knowledge lost?</p>
<ul>
<li>1}- The Abyss, where the poorest and more desperate live, is a good place to hide from one’s enemies.</li>
<li>2}- The highest Spires rise above the clouds. The rich and powerful live there, protected by their raven guards: soldiers wearing armour that lets them fly.</li>
<li>3}- Many gangs rule the Abyss, fighting over every resource (the Undying Moles deal in water, the Rust Hammers deal in weapons, etc.). If you need anything in the Abyss, you’ll have to talk to a gang leader.</li>
<li>4}- The Grey Spires are built on top of mining complexes. Your campaign’s main antagonist has found a way to collapse the mine, toppling the spires. Will the characters stop this plot, or help with it?</li>
<li>5}- Each Spire is controlled by a different noble family. This makes for a hotbed of political backstabbing that smart outsiders could exploit.</li>
<li>6}- After a Grey Spire noble is murdered, the authorities plan to flood the Abyss, drowning everyone living there as an example for others.</li>

            <h3>8.4.13. Last City of a Dying Species</h3>
<p>Why are they dying? Are they resigned, or trying to save themselves? If both, who will the characters choose to join, and for what price?</p>

<ul>
<li>1}- The City’s Heart is dying. It must be replaced by the heart of a leviathan, or everything will crumble to dust. Hunting parties are sent throughout the world, none has come back yet.</li>
<li>2}- The City’s inhabitants relive their glorious past in vivid, drug induced dreams. Visiting a House of Dreams can be dangerous, and many have succumbed from the nightmares of their own past.</li>
<li>3}- A small faction within the City has found a way to transfer minds into human bodies. To avoid extinction, they need to get their hands on as many hosts as they can. Unknown to them, the process slowly turns the hosts into mindless monsters.</li>
<li>4}- As punishment for major crimes, the souls of criminals are infused into weapons. One of the character’s patrons seeks to retrieve a weapon containing her son’s soul. It’s in the hands of the City’s First General.</li>
<li>5}- No one in the City knows about an ancient doomsday machine hidden at the centre of the world. It still has the power to destroy everything, and many would do anything to reach it, should the secret be unearthed.</li>
<li>6}- There is a way to save the dying species, or at least its history and memory. This cure is hidden in the antagonist’s capital.</li>
</ul>


        </div>
        <div class="col-6 col-12-small">


            <h3>8.4.14. City of Thieves</h3>
<p>How is order maintained in such a place? Does each member make a sacred oath to protect the City? Is that a tightly-knit community, with an “us against the world” view, or a den of iniquity where only traitors and bullies thrive? Do the Adjudicators, the demonists sealing all contracts between thieves, have an ulterior motive?</p>

<ul>
<li>1}- The City has no standing army. When it’s invaded by your campaign’s main antagonist, its inhabitants wage a brutal guerrilla war.</li>
<li>2}- A cursed mirror was brought to the City. It produces doubles of anyone looking into it. Stopping the process would require stepping through the mirror and vanquishing the demons controlling an inverse world.</li>
<li>3}- A newcomer known as the Dream Thief is stealing memories. They’re a highly paid mercenary whose real identity is unknown. </li>
<li>4}- A possessed killer hunts down the members of a demon trafficking ring. At first, the murders look like random killings perpetrated by a madman.</li>
<li>5}- The heroes are tasked to steal paintings by Ernst Crivelli. Each of his famous diptychs works as a two-way portal Three pairs are in existence, but some say a secret master painting can lead to any of them.</li>
<li>6}- A never-ending storm is drowning the City. Finding the spirit responsible for this will take the characters to the City’s reflection in the spirit world, where strange, ghostly guilds vie for power.</li>

            <h3>8.4.15. Theocracy</h3>	
<p>Is this a land of repression, superstition, and ignorance? Or the last refuge of art and knowledge? How many factions exist within the Church? What are their goals: conquest, isolation, purification?</p>

<ul>
<li>1}- A group of monks approaches a character, saying they’re the reincarnation of a famous saint. Honour and fortune await, as well as many enemies...</li>
<li>2}- The Church’s High Archon is accused of corruption, beginning a secret but brutal war of succession. Outsiders with loose morals and sharp blades are in high demand.</li>
<li>3}- The Theocracy searches for sacred relics everywhere, granting generous rewards to those who can find them. However, a sect within the Church seeks to destroy those relics, for they harbour too much power.</li>
<li>4}- A young woman performs miracles all over the Theocracy, spreading the word that the Church has become corrupt. More and more people gather around her, and the old regime fears a revolt.</li>
<li>5}- A being calling itself the Last Cherubim appears above the Theocracy’s capital and orders a great crusade against the neighbouring nations. Finding out the creature’s true nature might stop this madness.</li>
<li>6}- A popular pilgrimage has the faithful cross the continent on foot. They’re always in need of bodyguards.</li>

            <h3>8.4.16. Dust Empire</h3>
<p>In what kind of desert does it survive? Ash, sand, salt, rocks? Is it on its last legs, or a conquering power?</p>

<ul>
<li>1}- One of the many volcanoes found in the empire explodes, plunging the land into ashy darkness. Undead demons take this opportunity to seize power.</li>
<li>2}- The Empire’s water reserves are spiked with a drug that keeps the population docile. A traitor in the Imperial Guard wants the characters to smuggle proof of this out of the Empire.</li>
<li>3}- Independent tribes still resist the Emperor’s rule. Cunning elders created a prophecy about a leader that would unite the tribes. It is a puppet they want, not a saviour.</li>
<li>4}- One of the last dragons is imprisoned beneath the Empire’s capital, yearning for revenge. </li>
<li>5}- Surviving a three-day pilgrimage in the hottest part of the empire, with no water or protection, grants a pardon from the Emperor for any and all crimes.</li>
<li>6}- As a last resort, the Dust Empire can summon a tidal wave of sand that engulfs a threatening neighbour, turning the whole region into a desert. They will summon it soon… unless someone offers them a better solution.</li>

        <h3>8.5. What About Balance?</h3>
<p>True Balance only exists in a secluded location, far away from the struggle, obviously refusing to take part in it. Its role is merely to offer a temporary refuge to the characters. It should almost always appear ancient, forgotten, or decaying, reflecting the state of the world and the end of Balance.</p>

            <h3>8.5.1. Balance Stronghold (d6)</h3>
            <ul>
<li>1. A hidden monastery</li>
<li>2. A city floating in the air</li>
<li>3. A decaying fortress that can only be reached in dreams</li>
<li>4. An underground refuge, built by an advanced civilisation</li>
<li>5. A caravan, endlessly travelling the world</li>
<li>6. A simple looking tavern with doors connecting to every part of the world</li>
</ul>

        <div class="col-6 col-12-small">


        <h3>8.6. The End Game</h3>
<p>Your campaign may end with the characters having to side with Law or Chaos. If that’s the case, characters lose all gifts and powers associated with the power they choose to fight. If characters take different sides, let them duke it out. And if your players choose to let kings, queens, and emperors decide the fate of the world, they should still have to deal with the consequences.</p>

<p>Many fantasy settings are stuck in a status quo. Rulers can be killed, but new ones take their places. The world is meant to be saved or at least preserved. This shouldn’t be the case in a Black Sword Hack campaign: kingdoms and empires will disappear, and the world itself is not safe. The setting at the beginning and at the end of a campaign shouldn’t be the same. Whether the characters are agents of that change is for the players to decide.</p>

        </header>

<p>To help you create cities in the frame of the game, picture them as battlegrounds where factions compete for power. Inside those factions are people with their own agendas, putting them in conflict with others. Truces are temporary and any state of equilibrium doesn’t last. As the people living in them, cities will change in the course of your campaign. Some might even die, perhaps even at the hand of the heroes.</p>

<p>Nothing is ever clean or safe. Any weapon you buy still has blood on it. If you go to a library, someone else is looking for the same information. The moment you step inside a tavern, you’re being sized up — are you predator or prey? Cities are not a place to rest and recuperate. Tensions are visible everywhere: the innkeeper has a black eye, a sweet little kid is being bullied by the city watch, the dockers are on strike, a crowd gathers for yet another public execution... Cities are dangerous and dirty.</p>

        <h3>9.1. Birth Of A City</h3>
<p>You need three things to run an urban session: people, places, and problems. The good news is you don’t have to come up with everything at once. Pick a name for the city, think about the place the heroes will stay in or the NPC they’ll meet, and build from there.</p>

            <h3>9.1.2. People</h3>
<p>You need the following information: a name, an occupation, an affiliation – it all fits on one line, and it is enough to give you a rough idea of their looks, demeanour, and objectives. No need to flesh them out further as some hero might crush their head as soon as they meet them.</p>

            <h3>9.1.3. Power</h3>
<p>Factions gain power by controlling a specific domain: politics, religion, organised crime, labour, etc. Their main goals usually revolve around keeping the power they have or gaining more. Faction members often have specific or personal goals, and use their faction to achieve them.</p>

            <h3>9.1.4. Places</h3>
<p>People and factions are related to places. These can be obvious (the imperial palace) or hidden (the warehouse where the revolutionaries meet). Whenever the heroes are in a city, share a map or sketch, no matter how crude. The players can refer to this representation at any time. Encourage them to write on it: they can note points of interest and NPC names. These notes will bring the city to life for your players.  </p> 

            <h3>9.1.5. Problems</h3>
<p>And by problems, we mean conflicts. Between people, between factions, and of course inside factions. No organisation is monolithic, tensions come from diverging points of views (“do we strive for a peaceful revolution or a violent one?”) to more personal matters (“our leader caused the death of my brother, she must pay!”). To solve these conflicts, factions often need outsiders and that’s where our heroes come in.</p>

<p>Use these rules to inspire events during the characters’ travels. Don’t treat them as ellipses: each journey can lead the players to an unexpected adventure. And that is the whole point: by not letting travel interfere with what you or the players have in mind, you are depriving yourself of the strange and wonderful developments you wouldn’t have devised otherwise.</p>

        <h3>10.1. How Long is The Trip?</h3>
<p>If you don’t have a precise map yet or wish to create it as you go, use the following values: d4+3 days to reach the nearest city, d4 days to reach the closest town, or one day to reach the next village.</p>

        <h3>10.2. What Happens During The Journey?</h3>
<p>The world is never empty, each journey will lead to an encounter (it doesn’t need to be a violent one!). Simply make two rolls for the whole journey: One to learn the event’s theme and one to determine its subject.</p>

<p>Examples: As they are crossing the desert towards the Grey Oasis, what kind of event will the heroes face? I roll a 3 (Discovery) and a 15 (Outlaws). As no violence is assumed (yet), I might say that the characters discover the hideout of a band of desert raiders. That was easy, let’s try again: a 1 (aggression) and a 17 (soldiers). The easiest way to interpret this would be to let the PCs fight a bunch of soldiers, but that’s a bit boring (unless the players are itching for a fight). The heroes could witness an attack by deserters on an oasis, unless they’re the ones being attacked? This is a bit better, as it lets the players choose their course of action instead of forcing a fight on them.</p>

        <h3>10.3. Of Ships And The Sea</h3>
<p>As far as these rules are concerned, a ship can be a sky galleon, a deep-sea leviathan, or a transdimensional pyramid. A ship is defined by its number of masts, from one to three. You can replace masts with blood crystals, reactor cores, or whatever fits your setting. And by its crew, represented by a score from 8-13 (you can roll d6+7).</p>


            <h3>10.3.1. Travel</h3>
<p>The captain makes an INT test. If the ship has more than one mast, the test is made with Advantage.</p>
<p>A success means the travel time is unchanged<br>
A critical success means the travel time is divided by two<br>
A failure means the travel time is doubled<br>
A critical failure means the ship faces the perils of the sea</p>


<table>
        <caption><b>Perils of the sea</b></caption>
        <tbody>
<tr><td>1.</td><td>Storm: Minor damage to the ship, one day to repair</td></tr>
<tr><td>2.</td><td>Pirates! One ship with two masts and a small crew (5)</td></tr>
<tr><td>3.</td><td>Overboard: Part of the crew is lost (-1 to the crew rating)</td></tr>
<tr><td>4.</td><td>Reavers! One ship with three masts and a large crew (6)</td></tr>
<tr><td>5.</td><td>Tempest: Major damage (a week to repair) and the ship loses its way</td></tr>
<tr><td>6.</td><td>Shipwreck: The ship sinks, characters awake on an island</td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p>Once the peril is resolved, the captain needs to roll again.</p>


        </div>
        <div class="col-6 col-12-small">



            <h3>10.3.2. Combat</h3>
<p>The players roll a d20 for each mast the ship has. Each roll below the Crew’s score is a success. Successes can be spent as follows:<br>
- one success to destroy one enemy mast<br>
- two successes to attempt a boarding action<br>
- three successes to distance an enemy ship</p>
<p>If none or the rolls are a success, the players have to choose one of the following consequences:<br>
- the ship loses one mast<br>
- the crew score decreases by 1<br>
- the ship is boarded</p>


            <h3>10.3.3. Boarding Action</h3>
<p>Whether it’s offensive or defensive, you can resolve a boarding action one of two ways:</p>
<p>• Character centred: each character takes an action that helps boarding or defending. If half the characters succeed, the action is a success. For each character who failed, the crew score is reduced by 1.<br>
• Crew centred: the players make a crew test:a success means the party is successful, but it loses a few men (decrease the crew score by 1).</p>
<p>- a critical success means the enemy ship is swiftly captured with no casualties on your side<br>
- a failure means the boarding party is repelled (or the ship is taken depending on which side the characters are). The crew loses 1 point.<br>
- a critical failure means the same as above but lose 2 crew points instead.</p>

        <h3>11.1. Running the Game</h3> 
<p>Here are a few tips to help you prepare and run your games smoothly.</p>



<div class="row">
        <div class="col-6 col-12-small">

            <h3>11.1.1. Prepping the Game: Before the Session</h3> 
<p>When creating your world, you have to make some choices regarding sorcery, demons, spirits, and weird science. Only some of these elements should be present in your setting, or at least restricted to specific factions (only mad sorcerers use spells, only the evil empire uses weird science, etc.). If your characters hunt demons with firelances while summoning spirits and casting spells, that may sound fun for a while, but it’s not what the Black Sword Hack was designed for. The line between dark fantasy and dark gonzo is thin, and we would advise you not to cross it. This means telling your players that there will be some limitations to the kind of characters they can play so they’re able to experience a dark fantasy campaign in the classical sense of the term.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="col-6 col-12-small">

<p>When getting ready for the next game, think about what the characters did and write down if they left some unfinished business, or attracted the wrong kind of attention. Maybe the players had some plans for the next session. Refrain from coming up with a way to counter these plans. Clever and imaginative players should see their schemes bear fruit. It doesn’t mean it should be easy though, so make them fight for it.</p>

<p>On the practical side of things, make sure you know the players’ characters: write down their names and backgrounds. Know where they stand regarding the campaign’s main antagonist. After that, make a list of names specific to where your session takes place (you can draw them from the lists on page 104). Really, this will save your life. Don’t go overboard though: twelve names (with a mix of genders) and you’re good to go.</p>
        </div> 
 </div>

 <hr class="major">

<div class="row">
        <div class="col-6 col-12-small">


            <h3>11.1.2. Running the Game: During the Session</h3> 

<p>As you probably know, roleplaying games are mainly a conversation between the GM and the players. This conversation is driven by questions asked on both sides. Players ask questions to...</p>

<dl>
        <dd>
        <p>...help them make a decision (“Does this guy seem trustworthy?”)<br>
        ...get Advantage over an enemy (“Is there a chandelier in the room?”)<br>
        ...immerse themselves in the game world (“Why is this city in ruins?”)
        </p>
        </dd>
</dl>

<p>Although you’re here to give them answers, as a GM you also have to ask questions:</p>
<dl>
        <dd>
        <p>- To learn what the players want (“Why do you seek an alchemist?”)<br>
        - To understand what their characters do (“Do you want to bribe or intimidate the guard?”)
        </p>
        </dd>
</dl>

        </div>
        <div class="col-6 col-12-small">
 <hr class="major">

<p>Some of these questions are answered by the game system (“Your attack roll failed and now you’re hurt”), others by your GM notes (“Yes, there is a smith in the village”) but you’ll have to improvise the rest. Which is great: it means your players are being creative, leading you to unexpected places. Therefore, your answers should help the players make decisions (“That guy looks shifty”), get Advantage over their enemies (“You could try to lure your enemy beneath the chandelier”) or immerse themselves in the game world (“The city was destroyed by the neighbouring kingdom”). In short, your answers should keep them involved.</p>
        </div>
</div>






 <hr class="major">

<div class="row">
        <div class="col-6 col-12-small">

            <h3>11.1.3. Creating NPCs on the Fly</h3> 
<p>Non-player characters are everybody the players can interact with. Sometimes, your players will want to meet someone you hadn’t thought of. Don’t panic, you have all the clues you need: the character’s occupation (“Is there an alchemist in town?”) and the information or help they might give (“They could make a sleep potion for us”). Their location can be easily derived from their occupation (“Alchemists’ laboratories are usually well hidden”).</p>
<p>The only things you have to come with are 1) a name, and 2) a physical or mental trait. 1) is already taken care of (remember that list of names?) and 2) is easy if you take notes while reading sword & sorcery books or watching movies. Otherwise, just go with the first idea that comes to mind. It might feel obvious to you, but we guarantee that if your players don’t think it’s an original, unexpected idea (which they might, because the first thing that comes to your mind isn’t obvious to people with different minds) they will enjoy the continuity in sword & sorcery tone.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-6 col-12-small">


            <h3>11.1.4. Running Combat</h3> 
<p>Combat situations are problems that need to be solved in a limited time. That time is represented by the characters’ hit points. If that gauge reaches 0, they fail (and die). “Solving” a fight should bring information (“you find a map on one of the corpses”), supplies (“you find rations”), or new relationships (“the prisoners you freed want to help you”).</p>

<p>The low amounts of HP the characters and monsters possess ensure combat encounters are short and brutal affairs. Nonetheless, if its isn’t over by the end of the third round, something should happen: the battlefield changes (fire, rain, enemy movement, etc.), reinforcements appear, bystanders turn up, the enemy changes somehow (they’re afraid or turn into monsters), etc. Make sure NPCs and monsters have motivations (even as simple as “hunger” or “greed”). Only fanatics fight to the death, and these should be few and far between.</p>

        </div>
</div>




            <h3>11.1.5. Running the Game: after the Session</h3> 
<p>The session may be over, but your work isn’t. There are two things you should be doing at the end of every game session:<br>
1) Award stories to the characters if applicable. They need to grow to face what’s coming.<br>
2) Take notes! This is one of the few ironclad rules we’d like to enforce. These notes will help you create your next adventure. Make sure you keep track of:</p>

<dl>
        <dd>
        <p>- The characters’ successes and failures in pursuing their objectives<br>
        - The characters’ finds: clues, enchanted items, weird science gizmos, etc.<br>
        - The characters’ next move: what do they plan to do?<br>
        - NPCs’ attitudes towards the characters when relevant.<br>
        - The NPCs you had to create on the fly: you never know when you might need them again.
        </p>
        </dd>
</dl>

<p>Keep these notes in a way that’s entertaining to you: grab images from the net, draw some doodles (it might be an NPC or simply a scene from your last game), add some maps... It doesn’t have to look nice but it has to be fun, find the medium and method that suits you.</p>

        <h3>11.3. Black Sword Hack for the Lone Adventurer</h3> 

<p><b>Tools for All GMs</b><br>
All the tools we present here can be used by GMs for their regular games. So even if you’re not into solo roleplaying, keep reading!</p>

<p><b>This isn’t Just a Game</b><br>  
Playing Black Sword Hack solo is a great experience for both players and GMs. It’s not a lesser version of the game, or a clutch for GMs deprived of players. It’s an exercise in pure creativity that will develop your improvisation muscles. Imagination is a skill, these rules are your weapon master. Nothing can be too absurd, too far-fetched or too crazy. You have no audience but yourself. You can make mistakes, experiment with new things without anyone looking over your shoulder. Be kind, be open-minded, and these qualities will follow you to the gaming table once your personal adventures are over.</p>


<div class="row">
 
        <div class="col-6 col-12-small">

            <h3>11.3.1. Find a Title</h3> 
<p>The best way to learn is to start doing it. Grab a pen and a sheet of paper or notebook, and give a title to your adventures. Look at your RPG or books collection, mix and match words until something sounds right, meaning be damned. Here are a few examples (or roll a d8):</p>
<ul>
<li>1. The Dark Fate of the Wind Howlers</li>
<li>2. This Axe is Mine, an Executioner’s Tale</li>
<li>3. Devious Drusk, King of the Wasteland</li>
<li>4. Five Swords Against the Blood God</li>
<li>5. Night of the Bladespawns</li>
<li>6. The Twisted Destiny of the Scarlet Princess</li>
<li>7. Oksana: Thief, Gladiator, Queen</li>
<li>8. Trials and Tribulations of a Former Chaos Priest</li>
</ul>

        </div>
        <div class="col-6 col-12-small">

            <h3>11.3.2. Create a Character</h3> 
<p>Now go back to page 10 and create a character. No, not later; do it now or you’ll never do it. Trust the dice, do not re-roll, use what you’re given. Don’t try to make the character fit the title above or your own preconceptions. Tread new paths lest you want your mind to wither.</p>


            <h3>11.3.3.  Create your World</h3> 
<p>Simply place the names of each nation as you see fit. You don’t have to draw anything, you just need a rough idea of where they all are relative to each other. Roll a d6 on your map: the adventure starts here, use the result to select your prologue (see below).</p>
        </div>
</div>





            <h3>11.3.4. Prologue</h3> 
<p>How does your adventure start? For your first adventure we’ll help you kickstart your campaign. Use the result of the d6 you dropped on your map to learn how this all begins:</p>
<ul>
<li>1. You just got out of your cell in your father’s castle...</li>
<li>2. You wake on a beach, the image of your brother pushing you off a cliff still vivid in your mind...</li>
<li>3. You hide in the sewers as your city burns, you hear footsteps approaching...</li>
<li>4. Someone’s banging at your door, there’s a dead body in your bed and a blade in your hand...  </li>
<li>5. Your bounty took refuge in forbidden ruins; you reach them at sunset...</li>
<li>6. The card reader told you you’ll die in a week, killed by a headless monster. Now what do you do?</li>
</ul>



            <h3>11.3.5.  Now Play!</h3> 
<p>Act as your character would. When dice and rules are needed, use them; when you have a question, ask the Dark Gods’ Oracle (see p. 98). There’s not much more to it. There’s no “right” way to do this: you’re right as long as you’re engaged and want to know what happens to your character.</p>



<div class="row">
        <div class="col-6 col-12-small">

<p><b>Pacing</b><br>
Play a scene, encounter, or fight – anything that keeps you engaged. Once you’ve reached a conclusion, move on. Maybe you’ll run a trek through the jungle in agonising detail, hoping that your hero reaches civilisation before succumbing to the fever, or maybe you’ll resolve it with one roll because your character has more important matters to attend to.</p>

<p><b>Trust your instincts</b><br>
Never listen to thoughts telling you what your story should be like. Just run it. Don’t second guess yourself, the power of solo roleplaying is that it frees you of any preconception you (or your players) might have about what an RPG session should be. If the Oracle gives you an answer that keeps you guessing for more than 10 seconds, roll again or go where your instinct tells you to. You may be wrong, but mistakes are the only way to learn and improve.</p>    

<p><b>NPCs</b><br>
There’s usually no need to roll on any table to create an NPC. You’re in a village? You’ll meet farmers, a tavern owner, a travelling merchant, a hunter... Same goes in a city. The only thing you need is a list of names. If you’re looking for something oddly specific (an inquisitor, your bounty, a weapon master...), ask the Oracle! Only define the NPCs your hero is interacting with. Make a Charisma roll to determine an NPC’s attitude towards you if it is unclear.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="col-6 col-12-small">

<p><b>NPC attitude (CHA)</b><br>
<ul>
<li>• Critical failure: Openly hostile; doesn’t want anything to do with you, or attacks at once.</li>
<li>• Failure: Lazy, unhelpful, or irritated; simply wants to end their interaction with you as soon as possible.</li>
<li>• Success: The NPC is open, talkative, or simply sympathetic to you.</li>
<li>• Critical success: They feel connected to you (“I see you’re a veteran like me...”) and will help above and beyond what you ask of them.</li>
</ul></p>


<p><b>Enemies and monsters</b>><br>
Don’t try to balance encounters, just respect the logic of the world. Enemies try to surprise and outnumber you. Monsters are dangerous. There are two principles that must guide your combat encounters: firstly, people don’t want to die, and seeing that someone is armed can be enough to prevent a fight. Secondly, fleeing is always an option. If your character dies at the hands of highwaymen because you didn’t want to give them your money, that’s your choice, not a bug in the game.</p>
        </div>
</div>

 
<div class="row">
        <div class="col-6 col-12-small">


<p><b>Picking up a monster</b><br>
If you need to know who’s guarding those ruins, just roll a d12:
</p>
<ul>
        <li>1. Aberration</li>
        <li>2. Blind hunters</li>
        <li>3. Eaters of the dead</li>
        <li>4. Desiccated dragon</li>
        <li>5. First Born</li>
        <li>6. Ghost Legionnaires</li>
</ul>
<ul>
        <li>7. Giant animals</li>
        <li>8. Golems or living statues</li>
        <li>9. Hollow monks</li>
        <li>10.	Primordials</li>
        <li>11.	Serpent people</li>
        <li>12.	Skeletons</li>
</ul>

        </div>
        <div class="col-6 col-12-small">


<p><b>Companions</b><br>
Black Sword Hack is simple enough to let you run several characters through a solo campaign. Create them as you would any character, picking Origins and Backgrounds that fit and switching attribute scores as needed. Companions also provide replacement heroes if your main character bites the dust or let you tell spin-off stories if you feel like a change of pace.</p>

<p><b>Character death</b><br>
You can create a new character and move on, but you can also play this character as they find themselves in the netherworld, desperately looking for a way back to the world of the living.</p>

        <dd>- The defeat was extra hurtful (the death of a champion, etc.): roll with Disadvantage.</dd>
        <dd>- The loss was minimal: roll with Advantage.</dd>
        </dl>
</dd>

<dd>• Roll the usage die of the winning side: on the maximum result it is stepped up to the next highest die size.
        <dl>
        <dd>- The win is exalted or glorious: roll with Advantage.</dd>
        <dd>- The win is minimal: roll with Disadvantage.</dd>

<p>When Chaos and Law fight without the intervention of the player characters: roll their usage dice, the higher result wins. A 1 or 2 means a disaster (downgrade the Ud as usual).So aligned player characters can cause the end of the world by crushing the opposition (depleting its Usage die) or by being too successful (bringing their side’s Cosmic die over d12).</p>


<dl>
<p class="dd"><b>Optional rule: cosmic momentum</b></p>

        <dd>• When your side’s Cosmic die increases, your Doom die is stepped up as well for the duration of the next adventure.</dd>
        <dd>• For characters aligned with Balance, this happens when both Cosmic dice are the same.</dd>

        <h3>11.8. Friendly NPCs in Combat: the Allies’ Oracle</h3> 
<p>Black Sword Hack doesn’t really let you use heroes’ allies in combat. You can of course stat them up like a PC and have someone roll for them but should it prove too much work, we recommend this adaption of the oracle opposite.</p>


<dl>
<p class="dd">Roll a die for each NPC fighting on the characters’ side.</p>
        <dd>• 1-2: they are wounded and lose d6 hit points </dd>
        <dd>• 3-4: they are hit (losing d6 HP) but also attack the enemy successfully, inflicting d6 damage </dd>
        <dd>• 5+: they attack successfully and inflict d6 damage</dd>
</dl>

<p>If the character has special abilities, use the result to decide how well they work (okay on 3-4, well on 5+).</p>

        </div>
        <div class="col-6 col-12-small">

<dl>
<p class="dd">The die you roll on the Allies’ Oracle depends on the level difference between the NPC and who or what they’re fighting. </p>
        <dd>NPC level < Opponent level: roll d4</dd>
        <dd>NPC level = Opponent level: roll d6</dd>
        <dd>NPC level > Opponent level: roll d8</dd>
</dl>

<p>The above assumes the equals symbol (=) is a rough estimation: you should roll a d6 if the difference in levels is 1, even sometimes 2. Circumstances, weaponry, motivation, etc. can also impact the die type. Use your best judgement and agree with the players.</p>

        <h2>11.9. Evlyn’s World</h2> 
<p>This world was built by Evlyn Moreau and shared on her blog after the release of Black Sword Hack 1st Edition. We thought it would be a great example for you to draw on and get inspired by – especially since she doesn’t follow the procedure as written!</p>

<p>“What attracted me to Black Sword Hack is that instead of proposing you should play in one of the worlds from the novels it is inspired by, the game helps you craft your own doomed world, and lets your players save or destroy it.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="col-6 col-12-small">

<p>I think that this is the best way to write an RPG about a work of fiction: give the group the tools to craft their own setting inspired by the tropes and elements of the original works. This way the campaign is not constrained by the canon, and it doesn’t feel like you are playing in someone else’s campaign world, treading around a story that was already told.</p>

<p>A big part of the fun was the creation of our doomed world. We used the random tables provided in the book but instead of just the GM (me) rolling on them, I asked the players to in turn roll two dice, choosing the result they liked best. This way we were able to create the world collectively. I feel like this a great way to emotionally involve the players in the world they will save or lead to its doom!“</p>

<p><b>Advantage:</b> Players roll two d20s and choose which result to keep.</p>
<p><b>Attribute test:</b> When a character tries to do something that has a chance of failure, the player makes an attribute test by rolling a d20. Rolling below the attribute means the character succeeds. Rolling on or above the attribute means the character fails or that things escalate.</p>
<p><b>Character or hero:</b> A character controlled by a player.</p>
<p><b>Charisma (CHA):</b> A measure of a character’s ability to influence others.</p>
<p><b>Close:</b> Usually 1.50 m or 1 square.</p>
<p><b>Constitution (CON):</b> The body’s capacity to resist physical stress, pain, disease, etc.</p>
<p><b>Critical failure:</b> Getting a natural 20 on an attribute roll is a critical failure, forcing the player to make a Doom roll.</p>
<p><b>Critical success:</b> Getting a natural 1 on an attribute roll is a critical success. In combat this means the character does maximum damage and adds another damage die.</p>
<p><b>Damage die:</b> The amount of damage a character inflicts in combat. Normally 1d6 (1d4 when unarmed).</p>
<p><b>Dexterity (DEX):</b> A character’s deftness and agility.</p>
<p><b>Disadvantage:</b> The player rolls two d20s and keeps the worst result.</p>
<p><b>Distant:</b> Beyond 20 m (12 squares), the farthest range in the game.</p>
<p><b>Doom:</b> Some actions bring the world closer to its end, triggering the use of the Doom usage die.</p>
<p><b>Doomed:</b> Once their Doom die is depleted, a character suffers Disadvantage on all attribute tests.</p>
<p><b>Far away:</b> Usually 20 m or 12 squares.</p>
<p><b>Helpless:</b> A character that has no HP left, making the player roll on the Helpless table (p. 18).</p>
<p><b>HP:</b> Hit points, a rough measure of the character’s health, luck, and will to live.</p>
<p><b>Intelligence (INT):</b> A character’s ability to apply their knowledge to the situation at hand.</p>
<p><b>Long rest:</b> A rest that takes 6 hours. Characters recover all their HP, and Doom gets back to its maximum die size.</p>
<p><b>Morale test:</b> NPCs losing half their allies or their leader must make a Morale test: the GM rolls a d12, if the result is equal or superior to the highest level in the NPC group, they run away.</p>
<p><b>Nearby:</b> Usually 10m or 6 squares.</p>
<p><b>NPC:</b> A non-player character, usually controlled by the GM.</p>
<p><b>Ongoing damage:</b> Expressed as a Usage die. Victims take damage each Turn until the die is depleted. </p>
<p><b>Short rest:</b> Lasts 1 hour. Characters recover a number of HP equal to half their CON score (rounded down). A character can take one short rest per day.</p>
<p><b>Strength (STR):</b> A character’s raw physical power.</p>
<p><b>Turn:</b> The time needed for a character to move and act. The duration of a Turn varies according to the situation.</p>
<p><b>Usage die (Ud):</b> A die used to represent finite resources. When a resource is used roll its Usage die, a result of 1-2 means it is downgraded to the next smallest die. A downgraded Ud4 means the resource is depleted.</p>
