        </header>

 
<p>Creating a character is a three-step process: the player rolls their character’s attributes, picks an origin and finally chooses backgrounds.</p>
        

 
 
<div class="row">
 
        <div class="col-6 col-12-small"> 
        <h3>3.1. Attributes</h3>
<p>A character is made of six attributes.</p>
<p>• Strength (STR) - Raw physical power. Use STR to... Bash skulls, parry, perform feats of brawn.</p>
<p>• DEXTERITY (DEX) - Deftness and agility. Use DEX to... Shoot people in the face, dodge, ride, pick locks.</p>
<p>• CONSTITUTION (CON) - The body’s capacity to resist physical stress. Use CON when... Resisting fatigue, poison, or diseases, etc.</p>
<p>• INTELLIGENCE (INT) - The ability to apply one’s knowledge to the situation at hand. Use INT when... Deciphering a dusty tome, looking for an enemy’s weakness or the exit to a maze.</p>
<p>• WISDOM (WIS) - Steadiness in a stressful situation. Use WIS for... Initiative, overcoming fear, and resisting mental stress.</p>
<p>• CHARISMA (CHA) - A measure of a character’s ability to influence others. Use CHA to... Persuade or intimidate NPCs.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="col-6 col-12-small"> 

            <h3>3.1.1. Rolling Attributes</h3>
<p>Roll 2d6 for each attribute in order and note its score using the table below:</p>


<table>
        <tbody>
                <tr>
        <td>2-3</td> <td>4-5</td> <td>6-7</td> <td>8-9</td> <td>10-11</td> <td>12</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                <td>8</td><td>9</td><td>10</td><td>11</td><td>12</td><td>13</td>
                </tr>
        </tbody>
</table>

        <h2>3.2. Origin</h2>
<p>Pick one of the following origins for your character: Barbarian, Civilised, or Decadent. We use these words loosely, the way they were in pulp novels: a barbarian hero may value honour and courage but might easily succumb to violence and superstition.</p>
<p>A character coming from a civilised culture can cherish knowledge and progress but also be quick to deem others inferior or primitive. Decadent adventurers come from a doomed society, which could make them gloomy and miserable or carefree, just happy to survive another day. </p>
<p>A character’s origin is meant to springboard your imagination, not to turn your character into a cliché.</p>
