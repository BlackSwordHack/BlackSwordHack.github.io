                <h3>2.1.  Blood and Souls!</h3>
        <p>First and foremost, the players roll all the dice in combat: when monsters attack, the players 
        simply roll to defend.</p>

                </div>
                <div class="col-6 col-12-small">    
        

                <h3>2.1.1. Initiative</h3>
        <p>At the beginning of a combat, every player makes a WIS test. Those who succeed act before the 
        opposition (monsters and enemy NPCs), starting with the player seated at the left of the GM. The rest 
        act after the opposition, once again, in a clockwise fashion.<br> 
        • A critical success on the initiative roll means you get three actions instead of two on your first turn.<br>
        • A critical failure on the initiative roll means you only get one action instead of two on your first turn.</p>
                </div>
            </div>

                <div class="col-6 col-12-small">   

                <h3>2.1.2. What Can You Do?</h3>
        <p>During their turn, your character can take two actions (move, attack, use something, cast a spell, etc.). 
        Don’t forget you must roll your Doom die if you take the same action twice.</p>
            
                <h3>2.1.3. Attacking</h3>
<p>• Using a melee weapon: make a STR test.<br><br>
• Using a ranged weapon: make a DEX test.<br><br>
A successful attack deals damage (you roll your damage die).<br><br>
A critical success deals maximum damage, and you add another damage die on top of that.</p>

                </div>
                <div class="col-6 col-12-small">    
        
        
                <h3>2.1.4. Defending</h3>
<p>Defending is done during the enemy’s turn; it doesn’t count against the two action limit you get during your own turn. You can defend as many times as you need during your turn.
• Parrying: make a STR test<br><br>
• Dodging: make a DEX test<br><br>
Note: The character must be holding something to be able to parry. Ranged attacks can only be dodged.<br><br>
A failed defense roll means you take damage. <br><br>
A critical failure means your armour is ignored (see below).</p>
                </div>

                <div class="col-6 col-12-small">   


                <h3>2.1.5. Threat Level</h3>
<p>If an opponent’s level is higher than the character’s level, the player adds the difference between the two 
levels to the d20 when making any attribute tests to attack (if the character’s level is higher, no modifier is applied).</p>

                <h3>2.1.6. Weapons and damage</h3>
<p>Characters are trained fighters: the damage they cause with any weapon is the same (normally 1d6). Their unarmed
 damage is 1d4. These may change with Backgrounds (p. 24) and Gifts (p. 31).</p>

                </div>
                <div class="col-6 col-12-small">    
        
                
                <h3>2.1.7. Armour</h3>
<p>The armour’s protection rating is subtracted from the incoming damage (which can be reduced to zero).</p>

                <h3>2.1.8. Shields</h3>
<p>Shields give you Advantage to your defence tests when parrying. At the GM’s discretion, they may let you use
your STR to defend against arrows. A critical failure means the shield is broken.</p>

                <h3>2.1.9. Two-Handed Weapons</h3>
<p>These weapons give you Advantage to their damage rolls.</p>
                </div>
        </div>
  
<hr class="hr2">  
 
<div class="row">
 
        <div class="col-6 col-12-small">   
 
                <h3>2.1.10. Attack Effect</h3><br>
<p>If you want to add an effect to your attack, say so before you make your attribute test and then make a Doom roll. 
        NPCs don’t have access to weapon effects.</p>
<p>• Break: you break your opponent’s weapon (or a piece of equipment).<br>
• Brutal: add the Doom die’s result to the damage you inflict.<br>
• Disarm: you do no damage, but your target is disarmed.<br>
• Entangle: you do no damage, all further attacks against the target during this Turn are done with Advantage.<br>
• Flurry: inflict regular damage and immediately get an additional attack.<br>
• Pin down: inflict regular damage and your target cannot move this Turn.<br>
• Sacrifice: inflict double damage (triple if your attack is a critical hit) but your weapon breaks.<br>
• Shove: you do no damage but push your opponent (to the ground, overboard, etc.).<br>
• Sweep: damage everyone Close to you (friend and foe).<br>
• Vicious: inflict regular and ongoing damage (Ud4).</p>

        </div>
        <div class="col-6 col-12-small">    
 
                <h3> 2.1.11. Ongoing Damage</h3>
<p>Things like acid, poison, or fire deal ongoing damage. Roll for damage using a Usage die (generally Ud4 or Ud6) 
each Turn until the die is depleted. There should always be ways to stop the damage, like jump in water to douse the 
flames or apply anti-venom unguent.</p>

                <h3>2.1.12. Hit Points</h3>
<p>When a monster’s or NPC’s hit points reach 0, they are dead. At 0 hit points a character is Helpless, 
        unable to do anything except talk feebly. Once the fight is over (or the character is dragged to a safe place),
         the player rolls a d6:</p>

                <h3>2.1.13. Helpless (d6)</h3>
<p>1.   Scratched: the character is good to go except for a new scar.<br>
2.  Missed: one random piece of equipment is destroyed.<br>
3.  Impaired: Disadvantage on DEX tests for the rest of the session.<br>
4.  Injured: Disadvantage on all attribute tests for the rest of the session.<br>
5.  Butchered: lose 1 point of (roll a d6): 1-3: STR, 4-6: DEX permanently.<br>
6.  Killed: create a new character (of the same level).</p>
<p>A surviving character (results 1 to 5) immediately gets d4 HP back.</p>

        <h2>2.2. Recovery</h2>
<p>As soon as they opted for a life of violence, characters have shown an unnatural capacity to heal. 
It is said that the powers of Law and Chaos tend to favour those who fit into their plans. Anyone 
witnessing the PCs’ unnatural healing grows suspicious of them. People associated with the powers 
that be usually bring bad luck and death with them... In game terms, it simply means player characters 
recover HP by taking a short rest or a long rest. Everyone else needs medical attention and several 
weeks of bed rest.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="col-6 col-12-small">  

<p>• Short rests can be taken anywhere: they last 1 hour, characters recover a number of hit points equal 
to half their CON score (rounded down). A character can take one short rest per day.<br>
• Long rests can only be taken in safe environments: they last 6 hours, and characters recover all 
their hit points. Their Doom dice are fully restored as well. Some backgrounds and gifts may require 
a long rest to refresh. This is mentioned in their description (see p. 24 and p. 31).</p>

<p>What counts as a safe environment is up to the GM. It is usually a settlement of some kind with some 
degree of provided comfort. A campsite in the wilderness, where night attacks or interruptions are a 
possibility, is never a safe environment. You shouldn’t expect to have long rests while in the wild.</p>

        <h2>2.3. Combat Example</h2>


<p>Let us join two level 1 heroes, Morgelt and Akem as they face four cultists who don’t seem to be open 
to negotiation.</p>


                <blockquote>
<p>
<b>GM:</b> Make your wisdom rolls!<br>
<b>Morgelt:</b> Success!<br>
<b>Akem:</b> I must be doomed: 19!<br>
<b>GM:</b> Ok you’ll only get one action on this first round. Morgelt you go first what do you do?<br>
<b>Morgelt:</b> I charge them! Do I get a bonus?<br>
<b>GM:</b> You’re too close, roll your attack.They’re level 2, so you add 1 to your attack roll. <br>
<b>Morgelt:</b> Success! I roll for damage...6!<br>
<b>GM:</b> This cultist bites the dust, how did you do it?<br>
<b>Morgelt:</b> Uh, I guess I just crushed his head with my mace.<br>
<b>GM:</b> Now it’s my turn, one of the cultists tries to stab you, how do you defend: parry or dodge?<br>
<b>Morgelt:</b> Parry and it’s a success!<br>
<b>GM:</b> Akem, two cultists go for you, how do you defend?<br>
<b>Akem:</b> I dodge, my Strength score is crap.<br>
<b>GM:</b> Ok, roll twice [one against each cultists] Once again, you get +1 to the roll [as the cultists are level 2].<br>
<b>Akem:</b> One success and one failure...<br>
<b>GM:</b> One of the cultists successfully stabs you, you lose 3 HP. Akem it’s your turn, you only get one 
action this time because of your crappy initiative roll.<br>
<b>Akem:</b> Yeah I rolled a 1! That’s called karma, I stab this guy in the face!<br>
<b>GM:</b> Your damage die is a d6 so you do 6, plus another d6... You got a 5? That’s 11 total, 
more than enough to kill this guy.<br>
New round of combat, Morgelt, you’re up!<br>
<b>Morgelt:</b> I attack twice, so I have to roll my Doom die first yes?<br>
<b>GM:</b> Exactly. You attack the same cultist twice?<br>
<b>Morgelt:</b> No, one attack is against the cultist attacking me the other one is against 
the one that is still attacking Akem if he’s close enough.<br>
<b>GM:</b> Yeah I guess you can [the GM thinks it’s not unreasonable, and it makes the fight more dynamic].<br>
<b>Morgelt:</b> First my Doom die: I rolled a 4, I’m fine, I roll my two attacks: two successes, I roll damage I get a 1 and a 5.<br>
<b>GM:</b> You only scratched the one facing you but killed the other one. It’s his turn, he’s attacking you.<br>
<b>Morgelt:</b> I roll a parry and, fail, crap.<br>
<b>GM:</b> You take 3 points of damage. Akem it’s your turn.<br>
<b>Akem:</b> Hey! We’re both attacking this guy, don’t I get an advantage?<br>
<b>GM:</b> Well, no, you didn’t get a disadvantage when they were both attacking you?<br>
Akem_Fair enough. I roll to attack and it’s a success! I roll damage: 4!<br>
<b>GM:</b> They were already 1 HP, now they’re seriously wounded. They drop their weapon and beg for mercy. What do you do? <br>
<b>Morgelt:</b> Let’s take them prisoner. Maybe they’ll give us some information about what’s beyond this room in exchange for their life. <br>
<b>Akem:</b> Alright. But this was our first fight and I already lost 30% of my HP... Are you sure we should go on?<br>
<b>Morgelt:</b> Next time there will be more of them, and they’ll be waiting for us, we push forward. I have some healing balms in my rucksack.
Akem_*Sigh*
